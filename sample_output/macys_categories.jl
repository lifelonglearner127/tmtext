Most bedding sets add a few flourishes to the package. Choose from comforters or duvet covers, and standard, king or European shams. Finish any look with a bedskirt, or even quilted coverlet. In the market for sheets? Keep an eye out for comforter sets boasting fitted and flat sheets, plus pillowcases. For the minimalist, instead of a full sheet set, check out bed linen sets with only a basic fitted sheet and single pillowcase. Or if you\u2019re already set in the sheets department, why not go for decorative pillows? Time for pillow talk. In a bed in a bag set, shams are a staple. For a familiar rectangular shape, stick with standard shams; try king shams for a longer length. Living larger than a king? Go with a square, Euro sham. And don\u2019t forget accent pillows. Small in size but big on style, throw pillows like bolsters make a bed. Want it all and more? You\u2019ll love a room in bag, which brings even more to the mix. Decorate beyond the bedframe with panels, tiebacks and valances for the windows. Be united on the home front with a cohesive design that stretches throughout the entire room.

Wedges are ideal for off-duty looks, so head to a matinee, enjoy a leisurely lunch or go shopping in fabulous footwear that offers comfort and charisma. For a more casual appearance, try thong sandals with a wedge heel for added height, which look amazing with maxi dresses and knee-length skirts. Add some glam by looking for embellished shoes sparkling with crystals or sequins, or keep things simple with supple leather in neutral shades of brown. Dress up beachwear with boho-inspired espadrilles in neat, nautical color palettes. Uncover sandals and slip-ons in shades of crisp white with navy, red or beige. Look for cork soles with pops of vibrant hues. Bright orange, turquoise, hot pink, emerald-green, cobalt blue and cool mint make up the rainbow needed to bring out floral patterned dresses or chevron-striped tops. Blend and experiment with different color combinations to strike just the right attitude for a stroll down the boardwalk or along the beach. Looking for the perfect pair of shoes for date nights and special events? Black wedges are timeless choices that always work. Studs, sequins and sparkling embellishments are must-haves. Pick up a pair of peep-toe shoes to show off a glamorous pedicure. A black dress, a pair of bright blue wedges and a red lip go a long way toward stealing the spotlight. For a memorable look, go with a pair of booties that offer a mix of height and balance. At the office, stick to two-toned wedges. An open back and a peep-toe create a polished balance, especially with a mix of cream and black or white and navy. Mix in shades of chocolate-brown and tan for neutral days or add a bold splash of red with a monochrome suit.

Corsets and bustiers in colors like daring black will add a kick of pizzazz to your night. Features like sheer lace or satin fabric give your lingerie an even more appealing aura, while a strapless sweetheart neckline puts the finishing touch on a timeless piece of lingerie. Want a bra and panty set that\u2019s sure to impress your new husband? Opt for lacy thongs and demi bras that will give your figure a can\u2019t miss aesthetic.

Wedges are ideal for off-duty looks, so head to a matinee, enjoy a leisurely lunch or go shopping in fabulous footwear that offers comfort and charisma. For a more casual appearance, try thong sandals with a wedge heel for added height, which look amazing with maxi dresses and knee-length skirts. Add some glam by looking for embellished shoes sparkling with crystals or sequins, or keep things simple with supple leather in neutral shades of brown. Dress up beachwear with boho-inspired espadrilles in neat, nautical color palettes. Uncover sandals and slip-ons in shades of crisp white with navy, red or beige. Look for cork soles with pops of vibrant hues. Bright orange, turquoise, hot pink, emerald-green, cobalt blue and cool mint make up the rainbow needed to bring out floral patterned dresses or chevron-striped tops. Blend and experiment with different color combinations to strike just the right attitude for a stroll down the boardwalk or along the beach. Looking for the perfect pair of shoes for date nights and special events? Black wedges are timeless choices that always work. Studs, sequins and sparkling embellishments are must-haves. Pick up a pair of peep-toe shoes to show off a glamorous pedicure. A black dress, a pair of bright blue wedges and a red lip go a long way toward stealing the spotlight. For a memorable look, go with a pair of booties that offer a mix of height and balance. At the office, stick to two-toned wedges. An open back and a peep-toe create a polished balance, especially with a mix of cream and black or white and navy. Mix in shades of chocolate-brown and tan for neutral days or add a bold splash of red with a monochrome suit.

For a closer view at any time, have a vanity mirror standing by. Steam fogging the mirror? After a hot shower, you\u2019ll need a nearby towel bar.

Searching for an understated design? Try vertical stripes in neutral colors\u2014you can\u2019t go wrong with shades of grey. It\u2019s easy to mix and match bathroom rugs and towels when you\u2019re complementing earthy browns and creams. These hues also look great in monochrome\u2014solid colors can work wonders in larger bathrooms, where you have the freedom to experiment with the d\u00e9cor. All-white shower curtains lend a polished look to your bathroom, and subtle scroll designs and tonal patterns can keep them from being too one-note. For something between stripes and solids, try a color block design\u2014contemporary simplicity at its best. Evoking country charm is as easy as choosing from the wide selection of patterned shower curtains. Bring nature indoors with floral designs featuring birds, branches, and flowers in bloom. Decorating a bathroom for kids? Colorful curtains featuring cartoon characters make bathtime lots of fun. There are plenty of eye-popping designs for adults, too\u2014abstract art and oversized prints take bathroom d\u00e9cor to shimmering heights.

For the tub, shower caddies make storage simple. Hanging over the shower head or tucked into the corner, make room for every toiletry. For sink-side soap, you\u2019ll need countertop containers like soap dishes or soap dispensers. To keep the surface neat, try a tray to organize your toothbrush holder and tumbler. For your daily disposables, fill a jar or canister with cotton swabs and employ a matching tissue holder. From trashcans to hampers, you\u2019ll need a few key additions for the floor. With handy bathroom furniture, store more than just clothes. Neatly stashed away, but within easy reach, baskets or shelves are storage favorites. To make cleaning as easy as organizing, choose a plunger and toilet brush for the corner. Going high tech? Take your washroom into the digital age with bathroom scales. Wall space is the best place for a few classic powder room must-haves. During your morning (or before-bed) routine, a wall mirror is essential. For a closer view at any time, have a vanity mirror standing by. Steam fogging the mirror? After a hot shower, you\u2019ll need a nearby towel bar. If wall space is scarce, make the most of the area with a towel rack for the door. From sink to floor and wall to door, discover bath accessories to equip every inch of your space. Fall in love with a look? Choose your entire assortment of bathroom accessories in the same material, or mix and match pieces for a unique collection. Vibrant and bold, lacquer is your most colorful choice. Looking for something subtler? Try an earthy wooden set. For a faucet tie-in, metal is perfect. Gleaming stainless steel, bronze, silver, gold and chrome look great in the washroom. If you can\u2019t get enough sheen, go a step further with iridescent mother of pearl sets. Or how about the sparkle of glass? Looking for graphics? If you\u2019re interested in pattern, try porcelain, acrylic or resin. Explore stone and ceramics for solid and patterned choices in one place. With bathroom sets, match a motif from tiles to tub.
