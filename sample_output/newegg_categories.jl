Smartphones have a functionality that is more in-line with most computers than with older cell phones. Almost everyone has a phone with them at all times now, but it can be difficult to figure out which device would be best to purchase. Some shoppers may be turned off by all the extra bells and whistles a smartphone has, but there are still plenty of plain old cell phones available. These devices, now sometimes referred to as \"feature phones,\" can make calls and send texts but have only a few other functions, so users can stay in contact without being distracted by apps and games. By contrast, the market is flooded with different smartphones for consumers who want to buy the most modern gadget available. A varied selection of devices is available, the specifics of which largely depend on which carrier you choose. If the phone you want is not available from your network provider, consider looking at unlocked devices, which are not restricted to any one carrier's frequency. With all the extra features included in smartphones, you may want to buy accessories to make sure your device is reaching its potential. For example, music-streaming subscribers may want to find a pair of Bluetooth-capable headphones so they can listen to all their favorite songs without being wired to their phone. Smartphones are somewhat fragile because of their slim builds and large screens, so a case is necessary to protect the device. There are hard shells and soft body-gloves designed specifically for every make and model. iPhone 5 cases and covers are available, along with enclosures for many other popular models, and are ideal for shoppers who want their new phone to stay in top shape and be protected even if accidentally dropped. Heavier users may require extra chargers, because their phone's battery is unlikely to last through the entire day. Most smartphones can charge via an USB cord, which is perfect for office workers who want to make sure their device will be alive during the commute home. Shoppers can find any phone and accessory to suit their needs. Users should take the time to decide what their expectations are from a device, so they can make a more informed purchase.", "keyword_density": {"cell phones": "1.0", "phones": "2.3"}, "department_id": 7},

If 2011 was the year of the tablet , then 2012 will surely go down as the year of the Ultrabook. Most people aren't yet aware of these remarkable additions to the PC market, but most will come to know just how versatile, powerful and convenient Ultrabooks can be. Some of the best Ultrabooks are already being produced by companies such as Asus, HP, Lenovo, Toshiba, Acer and Samsung. To find the Ultrabook that's right for you, check out our Ultrabook Buying Guide . What is an Ultrabook? The Ultrabook concept, spearheaded by Intel, is essentially the next step in the evolution of netbooks. A netbook is a small, lightweight laptop that has been created with portability in mind. It has no optical drive (for CDs and DVDs) yet features a battery designed to last a long time, so most of its functions are limited to what can be accomplished on the internet. This kind of product is ideal for commuters, travelers and telecommuters who don't need a ton of software or peripheral devices to get work done. An Ultrabook improves upon the netbook by giving users a more complete computing experience. These slim pieces of machinery also come packed with high-powered features, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice performance for portability and style. Ultrabook Features To actually qualify as an Ultrabook, a PC must meet certain Intel quality standards for speed and processing power. The first generation of Ultrabooks run on Intel\u2019s second generation processors in the Core i3, i5 or i7, depending on what model you choose. And because they use a special low-wattage version of the processors, the new Ultrabooks have a much longer battery life \u2014 a five hour minimum. Ultrabooks vs. Netbooks Ultrabooks take much of the technology of existing laptop PCs and netbooks and improve them in basic ways. In addition to being lightweight like its netbook predecessor, an Ultrabook must be thin. Most weigh less than three pounds and are under an inch thick when closed. Also, the high-definition resolution of an Ultrabook is superior to most monitors available today. However, the biggest difference between an Ultrabook and a netbook is the type of hard drive each one uses. A netbook, despite lacking an optical drive, still has a relatively old-fashioned hard drive disk (HDD). This involves moving parts and requires a fan to cool so it doesn't overheat. Conversely, Ultrabooks feature solid state drive (SSD) technology, which means there are no moving parts inside of it. This is the same type of processing many smartphones and tablets use and makes booting up the Ultrabook a breeze. By using an SSD that has the operating system loaded onto it already, you\u2019ll be powered up and ready to start working within seconds. So instead of hauling around that heavy laptop through airport security and multiple business meetings, why not take a lighter approach? The Ultrabook has the power and battery life needed to carry you through a busy day without weighing you down \u2014 the perfect accessory for your modern, fast-paced lifestyle.", "keyword_density": {"ultrabook": "4.0", "intel": "0.6", "powered": "0.4"}, "department_id": 2},

Nobody wants to mess around with desk microphones with unnecessary feedback or large computer speakers that garble in-game music and distort what other players are saying. Serious gaming requires serious headsets, and finding one that works best for you is what raises your in-game performance. Like standard pairs of headphones , headsets have a variety of styles and sizes. Some have bands that go over the top of the head, others wrap behind and still others do away with bands altogether and clip to ears to avoid stressing the temples. A wireless set may be more up a gamer's alley, as these relieve the exasperation a tethered headset can provide. The real added benefit of a headset comes from the onboard microphone, a feature that not all headsets provide but one that's worth looking for. This function gives you the ability to talk and listen without getting excessive feedback from keyboard or electronic activity, as well as reducing the amount of interference on your end so that other people in your conversation can hear you more easily. As any gamer knows, a successful raid relies partly on good communication, so it's essential that everyone in the party knows who you're dotting before someone kites the group. Headsets come in a variety of colors and styles, and picking the right one with the best additional features will depend on your preferences.

You need something with enough power to function almost the way a laptop would, but without the bulk and setup of that sort of device. A tablet, such as the ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity Tablet PC can offer portability and flexibility, with built-in media devices and a range of services that make it as handy as it is easy to handle. Tablets come in a range of sizes and shapes, either with Wi-Fi connectivity or through a dedicated provider like Sprint, AT&T or Verizon. These services require a regular contract like a mobile phone, but they can also get online anywhere and at any time, much like a smartphone can. This will provide the kind of overall use that professionals and casual users alike can truly appreciate. Available in a range of sizes, picking a screen size is only the first step in choosing the device that's right for you. As the advent of Ivy Bridge revolutionizes the computing power of ultra-slim devices , the best tablets are able to process more than some laptops at this point without having to tote around bulky or heavy tools. The largest tablets are about 10 inches across - similar in size to a netbook - yet lacking the external keyboard or hinged shell. Some of these have front-facing as well as rear-facing cameras, meaning you can chat online or take pictures and video with a larger mobile device, and then simply upload the content straight to the internet. Peripherals for tablets are as smart, sleek and small as the devices they're designed to support. In some cases the covers that snap over the screen are actually the keyboards themselves, and mice can fold flat or slip right into the same bag as a tablet without any noticeable change in weight or profile. For users in search of a powerful mobile computing experience, tablet computers may be even be able to replace a cell phone or smartphone, providing all the same features in a single utility.", "parent_text": "Tablets", "keyword_density": {"tablets": "1.1"}, "department_id": 3},

Chances are a security camera is pointed squarely at your face. If anyone was to commit a crime on the premises, police would be able to track that perpetrator down quickly. You can achieve this same level of security at your home or personal business with surveillance cameras. Security cameras don\u2019t have to be the big, bulky models frequently seen in movies. Options range from small and discreet to front-and-center prominence, allowing you to choose how to handle your security. Larger, more obvious surveillance cameras can deter potential troublemakers by their sheer presence, while small cameras can be tucked away to ensure that, no matter what happens, everything is safely recorded. We offer many different styles of security cameras, from dome models that look just like light fixtures to wireless cameras and even those that feature night vision. Whether you\u2019re looking to protect your interior or exterior, we have the right style and capabilities for you. Some models even offer the option to record events directly to DVR, ensuring that you\u2019ll always have fast access to the footage you need, especially in the event of an emergency.! From inexpensive, discreet units to highly advanced rotational scanners, security cameras can protect your home, business and personal possessions. Check out the models we have in stock!", "parent_text": "Security & Surveillance", "keyword_density": {"security": "2.6", "cameras": "3.0", "surveillance cameras": "1.7"}, "department_id": 8},

Warm fronts can sweep through one day, but then later that night you could see record low temperatures. With something as unpredictable as the climate, it's best to be prepared for any possibility. Installing air conditioners can keep any space comfortable, no matter what the conditions are outside. If your home or office is too warm, you'll likely be uncomfortable, and you might be unable to relax because you can't cool down or stop sweating. AC units can regulate the temperature and let you breathe easy. Air conditioners do more than keep a room cool. The machines circulate air and filter out pollutants like smoke, allergens and dust, so the air is cleaner than it would be if you used a fan. This can also help eliminate airborne germs by taking them out of circulation, or at least sending them outside. Some units aren't powerful enough to filter air in multiple rooms, and not every consumer can afford to buy multiple ACs. Portable models or fans can provide the same functionality as those that sit in windows, while being easier to move. Most of these machines have wheels so they can be pushed from room to room with little effort. You can find more air conditioners online than you could in retail outlets. Stores carry limited stock, especially during the cooler months, and as such you won't always find the right model for your needs. Additionally, buying an AC from a digital storefront means the machine will be delivered right to your door so you don't have to carry it from the register to your car to your home. Air conditioners can make your home or office comfortable and cool. Instead of suffering through warmer days, you can enjoy controlled temperatures using your unit.", "parent_text": "Heating, Cooling & Air Quality", "keyword_density": {"air conditioners": "2.6", "air": "2.6"}, "department_id": 8},

Start by determining what you want to accomplish with your array of devices, and count on cables to provide the connectivity you need to make the dream a reality. Computer cables are essential for powering and utilizing your PC or laptop, connecting external devices and peripherals to enhance the experience. If your camera or camcorder doesn't have removable memory, USB and micro USB cables can get your media transferred from hardware to software devices. Network cables let you get online and share your uploaded images via the Internet. HDMI cables and USB cables connect your computer to your television and entertainment center. To get the best sound and balance out of your audio receiver and speaker system, audio/video cables like VGA splitters, basic RCA or component and composite variations, stereo and s-video cables all help you manipulate and connect hardware for maximized quality output. Extension cords are essential for larger spaces or for positioning your gaming and entertainment center with the most zen and flow, and not being tethered to the nearest outlet. To speed up your connections and make communication between devices easier, you might want to switch your USB cables to Firewire versions and try network Ethernet cords instead of basic models. Understanding your devices and finding faster ways to bridge them can be accomplished with competent cable connections and creative construction of your entertainment space. Extensions and upgrades can give you an enhanced experience without sacrificing connectivity, by choosing wiring that compliments your current cache of computing and media devices.", "parent_text": "Accessories", "keyword_density": {"cables": "3.6"}, "department_id": 14},

Or, you have a laptop and want to use it with your home computer's keyboard, mouse and monitor, without changing your current setup. The answer lies in a handy device called a KVM switch. KVM stands for keyboard, video, mouse. The keyboard, video, and mouse set collectively is called a \"console.\" KVM switches allow you to connect a console to more than one computer. You simply connect your console cables to the output jacks of the switch and connect the switch to the connections on your computer that the keyboard mouse and monitor would normally be plugged into. It's that simple. KVM Switches Let You Switch between Consoles To switch consoles, you just push a button on the switch and it allows you to use the other console. KVM switches save you money because you won't have to purchase separate keyboards, mice, and monitors for each computer you use. It makes it very easy when one person uses more than one computer at work, for example. They are also useful for server farms with one staff person accessing each computer periodically, one at a time. When buying KVM switches, it is important to fully understand your needs before you buy anything.

Achieving full functionality over variable connection volumes and different distances means giving it all the bridges necessary to send and receive data, be it within a local area or over a wide network. Various connections will require different kinds of ethernet cables and other cords, so determining your system needs should always be the first step. Ethernet cable comes in different categories and can meet various needs depending on what you select. Cat5 cables as well as cat6 cables are composed of a twisted pair structure, meaning a coupled set of wires is wrapped within a protective insulation casing. This design helps cancel out electronic interference and allows data to be carried securely over large physical distances. The color of the insulation casing can tell you how many twists per meter the cable has, what kind of wiring is present, the kind of connecting head it is compatible with and what uses it can handle. Cat5 cables have largely been replaced by cat5e, or enhanced cables, and cat6 cables also come in cat6a, or augmented, capacity. All variations offer a maximum length of 100 meters, but cat5/5e offers support of up to 100 MHz while cat6 can handle up to 250 MHz and cat6a is approved at 500 MHz. The cat5 cables also are unshielded, meaning interference stands a better chance of breaking the data stream if housed in an environment with many other competing signals. Determining which cord is right for your system will require accessing your space, planning your network requirements and pricing each option to find the one that most matches your performance and communication expectations.", "parent_text": "Network Cables", "keyword_density": {"cables": "2.9", "network": "0.7"}, "department_id": 14},

In terms of bringing external signals into your receiver, a coaxial cable can bring you satellite or cable television, unless you're working with some old-school gaming hardware, in which case a splitter can help you hook multiples of this cable together. More recent audio and visual devices will use DVI or HDMI cables, which will provide connectivity for basically every television, computer, home theater and music device you may want to hook together. Composite cables come in a rainbow of colors to help you get high-definition video and stereo sound with just a single connection, but with HD televisions and newer gaming consoles, the variety has grown to epic proportions with endless customization possible. Firewire cables can even come in handy for connecting computers with televisions, in case you want to share your Internet experience with a group of people or just want a single monitor or television in your home to provide you with all your entertainment needs. Creating a fluid home entertainment experience can't be easier with proper audio and video cables to get maximum synergy going with your whole suite of technological toys.

Writing them down on the go can be troublesome, especially if you are in a moving vehicle. Voice recorders are the perfect way to record your brilliant ideas without the need for cassette tapes or writing instruments. You can record memos, business meetings, an audio journal, and your phone conversations with these. Instead of storing the information on tape, the machines store them in digital formats. You can then transfer them to your computer to play them back or archive them, or send the audio files to other people through email. If you only need occasional voice recordings or basic functionality, a PDA or MP3 player with voice recording capability will probably suit your needs. However, if you're someone who needs to record conversations, you're better off with a dedicated digital voice recorder. Browse our site to find a large selection and the lowest prices on digital voice recording devices. While smartphones can do almost everything, their generalized functionality prevents the devices from excelling at some tasks. In addition, they have limited storage, and media files like recordings require large amounts of space. Content can easily be lost amid all of the documents stored on such devices, meaning that valuable information could be all but inaccessible. Additionally, some recorders have over 4GB of memory, meaning they can hold sizable libraries. Digital voice recorders only store audio files and can easily be connected to computers to export all documents. Some of these devices are equipped with built-in USB drives allowing you to easily save your notes once you're done recording. These specific models don't require wires, so they're more convenient to use while on the go. Sometimes you'll need to listen to something immediately, so reliable playback is a necessity. There are recorders with speakers and headphone jacks so you can listen to everything instantly without allowing anyone else to hear. Recorders feature strong battery life, so you never have to worry about them dying at an inopportune time. For instance, if you're recording a lecture, you shouldn't worry that you'll miss the conclusion because of a dead battery. Some audiophiles quickly notice the poor quality, especially in digital devices, and prefer analog gadgets. As an alternative, cassette recorders are also available. Some may argue that tapes are inefficient because they don't have large storage capacities, though tapes can be recycled so you don't have to frequently buy new ones. Whether you need to listen in on a business meeting after its conclusion or take personal notes throughout the day, a voice recorder may be one of the best possible gadgets for your job.", "parent_text": "Office Machines", "keyword_density": {"voice recorders": "0.9", "voice": "1.5", "recorders": "1.3"}, "department_id": 11},

If you need one of each, purchasing a four-in-one or three-in-one device can save you a considerable amount of money, especially if you purchase your fax machine here at Newegg. We offer state-of-the-art technology at the best prices you will find at any store. Features and Applications of Our Fax Machines Scanning and printing capabilities are two of the most important aspects of any fax machine, photo copier, or printer. If you prefer to have the capability to send and receive color documents, there are plenty of color fax machines in our online catalog. Surprisingly, color fax machines are not much more expensive than black-and-white-only machines. Modem speed is probably the most important thing you will look for in a fax machine. The slower the speed the lower the amount of pages you can transmit in a minute. Most fax machines today are in the 14.4Kbps or 33.6Kbs ranges and perform quite quick with transmission speeds between 6 seconds (slower models) and 2 seconds (faster models) per page. Manufacturers that we carry include Brother, Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, and Canon all with print options of color inkjet, thermal inkjet, or laser.", "parent_text": "Office Machines", "keyword_density": {"fax": "3.8", "fax machines": "4.7", "machines": "2.8"}, "department_id": 11},

It's inefficient for employees to manually enter every Universal Product Code (UPC). If customers have large purchase orders, it may take awhile for those transactions to be completed. Barcode scanners can simplify the entire process and save time during checkouts. These devices read barcodes and enter the product information directly to your registers. Employees simply wave the readers over items to check the prices. Every POS terminal is different and there are various scanner models for every system. USB barcode scanners can be used with almost every register. As long you have an available USB port you can sync the reader to your system and start ringing items. Employees shouldn't struggle with their hardware. Small problems can cause delays that frustrate customers who are tired of waiting. If a scanner's cord is tangled, associates have to stop helping patrons and untie the knots. Wireless barcode scanners are easy to use and don't require any additional steps to sync with POS terminals. Scanners have many advantages over entering prices or UPCs for every purchase. For example, if your employees manually enter item totals, there's no way to track inventory. Barcode scanners can help connect your registers to your stockroom so you can monitor which products are selling quickly and should be restocked soon. Barcode readers also help employees complete more transactions. Associates only need to press a button to scan an item through.

Without a good or at least serviceable sound system, audio content can be distorted and quality can be affected by feedback. Poor playback is especially noticeable while driving, as auto manufacturers don't typically install high-end car speakers. However, drivers can always seek out and install their own devices. The two most important features to look for when buying car speakers are sensitivity and power limits. Sensitivity refers to the sound your speakers produce based on the electricity they receive. Speakers with high sensitivity work best with radios with lower power levels and vice versa. Speakers can produce fuller sounds if they have more features. For instance, a 3-way model has one more driver than a 2-way device, meaning that mid-range sounds are louder. When listening to music, you'll clearly hear background instruments. There are even 4-way speakers that can produce much richer tones than their counterparts. Devices are available in every size and with various settings. You can find the best make and model for your vehicle, so you don't have to return your speakers due to incompatibility. Installing speakers is impossible if you don't have the correct components. Fortunately, there are bundles available that include all the necessary cables so you can easily connect your new speakers with your audio system. These packages are beneficial to budget-conscious drivers who don't want to hire professionals for the relatively simple task. Few people sit in silence on the road. Music is a necessity for most drivers, especially those who like to sing along to their favorite songs while they're in traffic or barreling down empty streets. Speakers play an important part in audio production, so if you want to hear every note clearly you should consider installing new ones in your vehicle.

This makes it ideal for devices such as digital cameras where batteries go dead often. With being able to retain data even when power is lost you can rest assured that all your pictures will still be kept safe on the memory card. Examples of flash memory cards include Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, Compact Flash (CF) memory cards, and Sony's Memory Sticks (MS, M2, MS Duo, MS Pro, and MS Pro Duo) to name a few. Other examples of proprietary and permanent flash memory devices include memory cards for video gaming systems. The Benefits of Flash Memory Flash memory is extremely small, fast, lightweight, and makes no noise or have any moving parts, unlike hard drives. However, hard disks can hold considerably more data and its cost per megabyte is much cheaper although prices are quickly dropping as capacity grows larger for flash devices daily. Yet flash memory is quite reliable and allows you to specify which data you want to keep. USB flash drives are known as the floppy disks of the 21st century. You can see people walking around with them dangling from key chains, backpacks, and even around their necks. These are more resistant to physical abuse than the media cards used in digital cameras. They're also an improvement over optical storage like CDs and DVDs, which are easily scratched. Prices of the drives have come down so much that many companies give them to clients instead of printing reports and wasting paper and ink. In some schools, students are required to have them. At Newegg, we stock a wide variety of flash memory.

Paying for an international call isn't necessary if you have a USB mic for your PC or laptop, making talking to anyone around the world as easy as turning on the device. These gadgets connect quickly and easily, are functional with any computer and provide unlimited high-quality audio to anyone you can connect with. These are also handy for online gaming with programs like Ventrillo, which allow for in-game communication, so long as you have the right technology on your end. Built-in microphones just don't offer the same quality as an external USB microphone, with enhanced clarity and sound customization that gives them superior performance to a base-level device. If you've ever wanted to do audio and sound work with your computer or electrical instruments, these are essential for getting studio-grade results. The more upscale models still offer the same plug-and-play connectivity, but with automatic level adjustment, analog controls and signal muting, some rival even professional-grade tools. A USB microphone of high caliber frees you from the anchor of a computer, letting you set it up with a wired or wireless connection to provide the best possible customization and function. Whether you're chatting with a friend on Skype, owning noobs in World of Warcraft or cutting a new album with your garage band, microphones that come attached to your computer just won't give you the same level of performance that a USB microphone can provide. With dozens of options for quality, clarity and control, there's no limit to how far you can take your voice using these devices.", "parent_text": "Portable Devices", "keyword_density": {"microphones": "0.7", "usb": "1.3"}, "department_id": 4},

There are portable devices at the ready to help meet your movie-watching needs with much less weight and more convenience than trying to jerry-rig conventional devices into a road-ready solution. A portable DVD player can hook up to any television with the right wires for immediate playback. Some are even equipped with Blu-ray technology, meaning you aren't limited to standard video quality if you purchase the right utility. These devices also have built-in screens, so if there's no TV present or the picture isn't good enough, you can just watch right on the device itself. What's more, portable DVD players are small, lightweight and compact, making them great for airplane and train travel. Some devices are so slim as to seem like tablet computers, while others feature multiple screens. One device holds the disk while the other maintains a wireless signal, allowing for several people to share the same viewing experience without everyone having to crowd around a single screen. Other models receive television signals and basic programming, while still others also come equipped for CD playback with built-in stereo speakers. These rigs look more like old-school boomboxes, but are still just as portable and multi-functional as their much slimmer brethren. Trading in profile for power, these devices provide far superior audio playback and can function as more than just a movie system, making it more of a full entertainment device that could be great for a child's room or a summer camp house. Great for home or on-the-go, portable DVD players allow for film viewing anywhere and anytime. Light, powerful and flexible, they are the perfect tool to round out a complete media experience, regardless of where you go.", "parent_text": "Portable Devices", "keyword_density": {"portable dvd": "1.8", "portable": "1.5", "portable dvd players": "1.8"}, "department_id": 4},

With a number of sleek styles and variable options, Bluetooth headsets can integrate with phones, computers, music devices and more to increase ease of use and keep your hands free for more important things. Mono Bluetooth headsets clip over one ear and are useful for walking around in public or taking a call in the car where there are plenty of other things that require your attention. Keeping one ear open will alert you to other conversations or potential situations in your immediate area that require a response and Bluetooth headsets let you do just that without taking away the use of one of your hands. Also, seeing as many U.S. states have laws restricting phone use - including texting and phone calls - while driving, Bluetooth headsets will keep you in touch with friends and co-workers without the risk of getting a ticket or putting other motorists in danger. A stereo Bluetooth headset covers both ears and is useful for playing video games or listening to music. You can go out for a walk or to the gym with your iPod or MP3 player, and not worry about getting a headphone cord tangled on yourself or the workout equipment. You'll be able to get up from your computer and get a drink without taking off your headphones or missing out on a minute of in-game or online chatter.

Our digital cameras cover all prices and levels of sophistication. Because there are major differences between these cameras, we offer you a detailed listing of specifications for all our cameras. Understanding the Specifications of Digital Cameras First of all, count your pixels! The most important number to be considered when buying a digital camera is the number of pixels or megapixels it captures. Pixels translate into resolution, and a high resolution results in clear, crisp, and detailed photographs. Most magazines require an image to print with a minimum print resolution of 300ppi (pixels per inch) for publication. To get that kind of resolution for four- by six-inch prints, you\u00a1\u00afre going to want at least a four-megapixel camera. If you plan on blowing pictures up to eight by ten inches, on the other hand, you\u00a1\u00afre looking for at least 8 megapixels, and if you enter the rarified rangers above that, you have a professional-grade camera. Newegg carries cameras with up to 16 megapixels! For the highest quality digital photographs, get a camera that has at least 3X optical zoom. The less expensive cameras have digital zoom, but that zoom is restricted by the camera\u00a1\u00afs resolution, and higher digital zoom images may appear blurry or pixilated. Here at Newegg, our most sophisticated digital cameras have 12X optical zoom. Shutter speeds are the other major factor to be considered when selecting a digital camera. The slower the shutter, the blurrier your pictures could be. If the shutter speed is 1/30, using a tripod is a must. When shutter speed is upwards of 1/125, you can take clear pictures of moving cars and trucks. In addition to the above specifications, you should also consider memory storage, battery life, the type of batteries the camera takes, and whether or not the camera is compatible with photo editing software. Many of the newer cameras support automated shooting modes which adjust the settings for you based on commonly-used situations. That, plus other features such as automatic image stabilization, which uses computer memory to refine an image in motion, can help you get the most satisfaction for your dollar.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"digital cameras": "2.5", "cameras": "2.5", "digital": "2.5"}, "department_id": 4},

Every picture should be clear and focused, but this may be difficult to do consistently if the camera is held in hand. Instead of thinking only about a photo's subject, photographers must make sure their hands are steady and have the correct angle for the shot. A camera tripod reduces those concerns, so these artists only have to think about what pictures to take. A tripod is a steady base for a camera that holds the device in a mounted, fixed position. Even the slightest movement on the photographer's part can cause an image to be blurry or out of focus. A camera stand eliminates the need for reshoots by eliminating much of the risk of human error. There are different tripods available depending on the chosen medium. Photographers mostly deal with still images, so it might be best to buy a stand with a static camera base to focus on one subject during a shot. For videographers who need to follow action while recording, a tripod with an adjustable head allows for easier panning. You should make sure all your equipment is safe during transport and easy to carry, as well. A bag can protect your new stand and some of your other equipment. Some carrying cases include extra padding and rigid outer shells to protect your camera from any accidents - like falling onto concrete or landing in water. Other bags are designed with a tripod in mind, so you can sling it over your shoulder and still have your hands free to take pictures while on the go. Whether you're a professional photographer or a hobbyist, it's important to make sure you're capturing an image as the eye sees it.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"camera": "2.3", "tripods": "0.3"}, "department_id": 4},

However, with Micro Four technology rolling out, allowing more camera owners to take advantage of diverse accessories, it\u2019s important to understand what options are available. Individual lenses can improve your close-ups, wide shots and panoramas. Specialty camera lenses give you better image quality at night, with high-speed targets or in bright spaces with lots of refracted light sources, like beaches or snowy fields. Focal length will also determine how much of a zoom your shots will require, because it forces a perspective change past a certain point. Telephoto lenses with enhanced zoom can help get around that problem when centering on an individual subject of interest, but for those looking for a wider shot, perhaps lens diameter, rather than reach, is what's most important. A prime lens or zoom lens will be your first consideration. Prime lenses are less expensive and better for low-light situations and faster subjects, as well as being generally lighter and smaller to carry. A zoom lens will help you get close to the action no matter how far away you are, without struggling to change lenses. Deciding whether you want to focus your camera work on outdoor or indoor subjects, close-up or wide-angle events and the kind of lighting you're most likely to encounter are key for picking the right lens for you.. Remember that you can only get so much out of an individual lens. While the images you get may still look good, having the right tool for the job is crucial when you're trying to get the best image possible.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"camera": "1.7", "camera lenses": "1.4", "lenses": "2.1"}, "department_id": 4},

Digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, such as the Canon EOS 5d Mark II , give automatic feedback and allow you to review the work you've just shot so you can determine if you need to adjust shutter speed, brightness or aperture size, giving you more control over your process and product. These devices are powerful, flexible and can be upgraded without having to continually purchase new technology, unlike a standard digital camera that might age out of modernity much more quickly. These are built much like a traditional SLR camera but with digital storage and a screen like a standard digital that shows what you've shot. This helps you make adjustments, change the subject or fine tune other aspects within the frame to get the best image possible. The other nice addition is storage capacity. Unlike an SLR requiring rolls and rolls of film that's costly to develop, these cameras take memory cards with gigabytes of storage space. You don't need to switch out rolls or pay to develop them, and you don't need to worry about running out of space in the middle of a shoot. Like a standard SLR camera, there are lenses and flash devices that can be attached to the body of the device to extend zoom and give better shots in difficult weather conditions, such as rain or night shoots.

Our digital cameras cover all prices and levels of sophistication. We offer you a detailed listing of specifications for all our cameras so you can choose the features and capabilities you need and want. Understanding the Specifications of Digital Cameras First of all, count your pixels! The most important number to be considered when buying a digital camera is the number of pixels or megapixels it captures. Pixels translate into resolution, and high resolution results in clear, crisp, and detailed photographs. Most magazines require an image to print with a minimum print resolution of 300ppi (pixels per inch) for publication. To get that kind of resolution for four- by six-inch prints, you're going to want at least a four-megapixel camera. If you plan on blowing pictures up to eight by ten inches, on the other hand, you're looking for at least 8 megapixels, and if you enter the rarified rangers above that, you have a professional-grade camera. Newegg carries cameras with up to 21 megapixels! For the highest quality digital photographs, get a camera that has at least 3X optical zoom. The less expensive cameras have digital zoom, but that zoom is restricted by the camera's resolution, and higher digital zoom images may appear blurry or pixilated. Here at Newegg, our most sophisticated digital cameras have 18X optical zoom. Shutter speeds are the other major factor to be considered when selecting a digital camera. The slower the shutter, the blurrier your pictures could be. If the shutter speed is 1/30, using a tripod is a must. When shutter speed is upwards of 1/125, you can take clear pictures of moving cars and trucks. In addition to the above specifications, you should also consider memory storage, battery life, the type of batteries the camera takes, and whether or not the camera is compatible with photo editing software. Many of the newer cameras support automated shooting modes which adjust the settings for you based on commonly-used situations. That, plus other features such as automatic image stabilization, which uses computer memory to refine an image in motion, or automatic face recognition, can help you get the most satisfaction for your dollar.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"shoot": "0.2", "digital cameras": "2.5", "cameras": "2.2", "digital": "2.5"}, "department_id": 4},

All you have to do is connect your digital camera to the dock, and either transfer files to your computer, or if you have a printer dock, print as many copies as you want. Forget paying for doubles. Print triples, quadruples, or even more if that is what you desire. As with all digital home electronics, camera docks are available at various levels of sophistication for different photographic results. Advanced Digital Camera Docks versus Basic Docks Standard camera docks connect to your computer through a USB cable. The images are stored as JPEGs, allowing you to use any photo editor to crop, re-size, or edit the pictures in any way you like. If you have a high-level printer, you can print high-definition color photos either on standard paper or glossy photograph paper. The most basic printer docks, on the other hand, do not require the help of a computer. They produce photos in one size, usually four inches by six inches, which is the standard size you receive when your photos are developed at a store. Higher-level docks can print wallet-size photos, standard-size pictures, and a size in between the two. Using the more advanced printer docks, you can print several copies at once. The latest models have built-in image enhancers. If you want a printer dock, check for specifications on print speed and compatibility. Some docks do not require a physical connection to your camera, which is a great feature if you want to print photos taken on your phone camera.

How to Choose a GPS Receiver Almost all receivers are accurate within 15 meters, but some are even more exact. Another factor to consider is whether you need voice directions. If you frequently drive alone to new places, voice directions are desirable. While many GPS receivers have well-lit LCD displays, it can still be difficult to read while driving. You can always turn the voice off when you do not need it. If you like to measure distances or track your average speed, many GPS receivers can do this for you.

The car stereo is the device that most people turn to for entertainment during long rides. Whether they listen to news broadcasts or turn up their favorite songs, consumers enjoy hearing something other than their roaring engines and spinning tires. Auto manufacturers don't often put high-end stereos into their vehicles, but any system can be replaced with another that features more components and accessories than standard devices. Most models receive AM and FM signals, but certain radios have different features that not every driver will require. For instance, some models have LCD displays that use touchscreen navigation. These stereos may be more useful to consumers who think it's unsafe to use buttons and knobs while driving. Some devices have DVD players as well, allowing passengers to watch movies or TV shows during those long journeys. Less tech-savvy drivers may prefer radios that resemble their current models but boast increased functionality. Smartphones and MP3 players are commonly used to stream music and podcasts, so consumers may want a gadget that can sync with their mobile devices. Fortunately, radios with connection ports that are compatible with most wires are available. There are also some models with USB slots, while others use headphone jacks. Finally, some car stereos feature docks that ensure your mobile device is secure while you drive. If you don't want to tether your phone to your radio, you should consider a device with Bluetooth compatibility. The wireless technology can be convenient, but keep in mind that it can quickly drain your device's battery. The open road can be a quiet and lonely place, so you need a high quality stereo to listen to your favorite songs and broadcasts. You spend a long time in your car and should enjoy yourself while driving.

Whether you're looking to totally overhaul your interior and turn it into a performance machine or if you'd just prefer a boost in quality music enjoyment while on the go, car subwoofers will enhance your audio experience. To make your windows rattle, car subwoofers enhance bass quality by amplifying and feeding the audio signal back through an enclosure between 8 and 21 inches in diameter to produce a frequency of 20 to 200 Hz. The lower the frequency, the higher quality the sound will be - and the bigger the beats. The subwoofer will also filter out other frequencies, allowing for better quality and producing a clearer sound. Depending on the quality of your hardware and the inputs you provide it with, you can establish a crossover point where the treble and bass are perfectly balanced, providing the ultimate mix of highs and lows for playback enjoyment. For more balanced output, car subwoofers can give you the ability to fine-tune your listening experience in infinitely more satisfying ways than a standard car audio system right off the factory line can provide. Choosing your own hardware and getting a custom installation can give you the performance and quality you may only otherwise experience at the theater. Combining compact and affordable audio options that are on the level of high-end versions with sophisticated output adjustments, car subwoofers allow you to adjust your audio levels to optimize the listening experience.", "parent_text": "Car Electronics", "keyword_density": {"car": "2.7", "car subwoofers": "3.8"}, "department_id": 4},

As Americans spend more time on the road, we are trying to be as connected to home and the office as possible. Various automotive electronics are available to keep car rides entertaining and safe, while at the same time, providing us with our gadget fix. Automotive In-Car Accessories to Improve Safety and Entertain One example of popular automotive electronics is an audio transmitter that allows you to play music from a flash drive. If you don't have an MP3 player or CD player in your car, but you do have a vehicle and a flash drive, you could use this device to listen to MP3 files through your car stereo. You just need to load up your storage drive with MP3s and plug it into the USB port on the device. Then, you tune your radio into one of the preset FM channels and listen away! Automotive electronics can help enhance safety features, too. Rear view camera systems allow you to see and hear what is behind your vehicle. They have largely replaced rear view mirrors because they have wide-angle lenses and provide a clearer vision than mirrors. Using such a camera helps prevent accidents by allowing you to see a lot more of what's around you. Other automotive electronics that have become popular in the last few years include satellite radio systems, GPS navigation systems, DVD players, and video game systems. Hands-free headsets for cell phones, which have become required by law in many states, add an additional level of safety for those who need to talk and drive at the same time.

Mono Bluetooth headsets clip over one ear and are useful for walking around in public or taking a call in the car where there are plenty of other things that require your attention. Keeping one ear open will alert you to other conversations or potential situations in your immediate area that require a response and Bluetooth headsets let you do just that without taking away the use of one of your hands. Also, seeing as many U.S. states have laws restricting phone use - including texting and phone calls - while driving, Bluetooth headsets will keep you in touch with friends and co-workers without the risk of getting a ticket or putting other motorists in danger. A stereo Bluetooth headset covers both ears and is useful for playing video games or listening to music. You can go out for a walk or to the gym with your iPod or MP3 player, and not worry about getting a headphone cord tangled on yourself or the workout equipment. You'll be able to get up from your computer and get a drink without taking off your headphones or missing out on a minute of in-game or online chatter.

Depending on the signal strength of the charging stand, you can even take it to a different floor or outside the house without worrying about dropping the call. Unlike with a cell phone or bluetooth device, this can make a cordless phone a more desirable option when you're making calls from home. Furthermore, by ditching the cords and removing the physical tether, you've got the freedom to roam while you talk so you can get things done and not be forced to stay in one place or cut short a conversation. A cordless phone can also have a number of other receivers set up throughout the house. This means that multiple handsets and charging bases can be married to a single main dock - but you can charge them on any available unit. Additionally, you'll never have to worry about running through the house searching for a receiver again - you can sync three or more cordless phone cradles in various rooms of the house and have easy access for incoming or outgoing calls.

You have a half-dozen computers working together, sending and receiving documents, collaborating on projects, communicating quickly and easily without the interference and lag of a general connection, and you're confident that your network is running properly. Then, you realize that you have to print something. Getting printers set up and accessible within a network structure can be frustrating, especially when working with remote servers and accessing machines, but print servers can assist with getting these devices working more quickly. Whether wired or wireless, these devices plug in to printer network connection ports, granting usage for authorized users and those within the system. As not every manufacturer makes printers compatible with every kind of network or every other print device on the market, a print server can override this incompatibility, making a device usable as long as it has the right adapter. It's also great for offices with multiple printers. A network can host so many machines that it's cumbersome to have all print jobs routed to the same printer, especially when a device is built to handle multiple functions. A printer can also be a scanner, copier and fax machine, making it necessary to have more than one machine to fit unit-task needs, so routing them all into a single client can make it easy for users in a vast network to select a device that's not busy. This also helps when one of these printers inevitably gets jammed. Print servers hook devices into a network in a way that makes them most useful to the greatest number of users. These devices are affordable and easy to install, increase the productivity and flexibility of those working with them and can help make an office a much saner place to work.", "parent_text": "Office Equipment", "keyword_density": {"printer": "2.2", "servers": "0.9"}, "department_id": 4},

Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption.

The primary draw, for many of those looking to acquire a home theater system, is the surround sound - hearing and feeling the strains of the musical score, sound effects and dialogue swirl around you and transport you to another place. A system worth its salt, so to speak, should have four satellite speakers, a center channel and a powerful subwoofer, to experience the loudest bass booms and the quietest dialogue in crystal clarity. Many systems at various price tiers feature that exact speaker layout. Those looking for a set-up that's a little bit simpler and involves less chance of cables becoming confusingly intertwined can find systems with wireless speakers. While no sound system can be truly \"wireless,\" some feature two or more speakers that use an infra-red connection and help you cut down on clutter. Despite all that talk about sound, the image is - of course - just as important. Your primary choice will be between a home theater with a Blu-ray or DVD player. The former can play films on either format, and obviously provides high sound and picture quality in resolution as high as 1080p. A system featuring the latter, meanwhile, will be significantly cheaper in almost all instances. That said, Blu-ray is becoming a more common format in today's market, and as such it's more affordable for the average consumer than ever before.

In some models, content can be transferred from the player to a laptop, smartphone or tablet and playing it on the smaller device. Additionally, the average Blu-ray player often allows you to store music, video, photos and other media by uploading it via a USB device. Some - typically those on the moderate to high end of the price spectrum - are also programmed to be 3D capable and will produce even more stunning images when paired with an appropriately outfitted television. Sometimes, though, the most useful features are some of the simplest. With a typical Blu-ray player, one of its primary attributes is the ability to improve the audio and visual quality of the DVDs you use it to watch.

There are even font packages that allow for more customization of banners, fliers and other documents created in these formats. Graphic design and drawing are also easy with specialized programs. Adobe's CS6 and Photoshop elements offer custom packages just for Mac users, and even AutoCAD gets suites from Autodesk. Music maestros also have software to help create and record tracks, mix tapes and create custom sounds. Video editors get a share of the action too, with suites from roxio that allow cropping, special effects and even transfer of files from older formats to DVD. Of course, protecting a Mac is also a huge responsibility, and custom software exists to meet this end. Symantec and Trend Micro have programs specifically designed to cope with the burgeoning online threat to the infrastructure that exists for Apple products. Installing custom art, text and creativity programs is one thing, but unless you look into protecting them as well, the whole investment could be lost to a wayward Trojan.", "parent_text": "Software", "keyword_density": {"mac": "2.5", "software": "1.3"}, "department_id": 5},

For example, the two latest Windows operating systems, 7 and 8 , have kept user-favorite features while upgrading other content. Windows 7 has been a popular Windows OS due to its intuitive design, which is much more user-friendly than that of previous generations. On-screen navigation has been simplified with a larger, customizable taskbar, so popular applications can be opened with only a single click. While there are many versions of Windows 7, Ultimate offers increased security and data backup. The OS comes with BitLocker, a hard drive encryption program. Windows 7 Professional offers advanced storage, as well, which prevents unsaved documents from being lost during hardware malfunctions. Windows 8 is the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system. The platform features interfaces that have been optimized for mobile and desktop computing, though both menus can be used easily on computers and tablets. Users don't have to buy new laptops to use Windows 8, because multiple versions of the OS are available. Windows 8 is the basic OS upgrade, providing users with new features such as the tiled start screen and downloadable apps from the Windows Store.

Less expensive digital imaging and editing software programs are not always less than adequate. Some offer great value and may or may not be easier to use. Mid-level programs contain more features than the basics yet are easier to learn than advanced programs like Photoshop. However, if you are designing documents that will be commercially printed and need color separation, make sure the software supports CMYK. PaintShop Pro is one example of a mid-level program that is affordable enough for the average user and easier to learn than Photoshop. Graphics Suites with Digital Imaging and Editing Software Programs Suites of image editing programs will help you with vector-based drawing and pixel-based image editing. Some come with organizational tools that help you categorize your photos, mark them for editing and printing, as well as improve them with color correction and other effects. You'll have creative control as well as an easy time learning how to use the software. You can also turn your photos into slide shows or video productions to share with family and friends. CorelDraw Graphics Suite is one such suite that competes very well with Photoshop and Illustrator. It helps you with image editing, digital painting, Web graphics, animation, and vector drawing.

You'll also have better control over what content is available on your website due to such new software. Other programs are designed to make financial tasks easier and less time consuming. Currently, finance software titles that can handle everything from taxes to payroll and expenses to revenue are available. Finance software makes it possible for a business to perform its own bookkeeping and eliminates the need to hire outside consultants. Make sure you buy software that's compatible with all your computers' OS's. Many programs that work on a Windows-based PC won't work on a Mac and vice versa. This can also be a problem when trying to share documents - sometimes the formats aren't compatible from one OS to another, making files inaccessible to employees operating on different systems.

They have all the same connectivity and require no different cables than a standard television, meaning it's no extra investment if you are just replacing a couple of existing devices to save space.

A bulb behind the glass lights up the display whenever a current is passed through the LCD solution. Plasma screens also have two sheets of glass but between them is a layer of phosphor pixels. When UV rays strike the pixels, the gas in them glows. Essentially, each pixel is its own fluorescent light bulb. On large TV screens, such as those in the 60 to 63 inch range, plasma displays typically outperform LCD displays with plasma units displaying a brighter, crisper image even at large sizes. Top LCD's have gotten close in performance, however, it will cost you. A major selling point and advantage to both types of monitors is their thin, flat size.

Pros and Cons Both Plasma and LCD TV's are thin, lightweight and easy to move, with most being wall-mountable, providing drastically greater options for home theatre setup. Both boast long display life's of about 60,000 hours or roughly 20 years if used 8 hours a day although this can vary according to other environmental and use factors. Additionally, both offer HDTV options in 720P, 1080i, and 1080p depending on size of screen. Considerations of Plasma TVs include excellent picture quality, wide viewing angles, and they are usually available in screen sizes from 37 inches to 60+. However they do tend to have glass screens that can reflect room lighting. Considerations of LCD TVs include excellent picture quality, have matte screens for less external light reflection, and they are usually available in screen sizes from 5 inches to 50+. However their viewing angles aren't as extreme as plasmas. What should you consider before purchase? LCD televisions are currently available in a variety of screen sizes and dimensions. LCD TVs are now available in screen sizes exceeding 50 inches. A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions. LCD TV screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD television can support. An LCD television typically provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 4:3 , similar to a standard monitor's aspect ratio of 5:4. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD television's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD television\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD televisions today can provide over 500 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Contrast Ratio is the degree of variation of the whitest and darkest parts of the image, is a very important factor to note. If the LCD TV has a low contrast ratio, dark images will look muddy and gray, while light images will look washed out. A good contrast ratio to have in an LCD TV is 1,000:1 or higher. Almost all LCD-TVs have built-in NTSC tuners , with some feature dual-tuners for PIP functions. An increasing number of new LCD-TVs also have built-in HDTV tuners .", "parent_text": "Televisions", "keyword_density": {"lcd": "3.3", "right": "0.4", "plasma": "0.9", "vs": "0.9"}, "department_id": 4},

Rather than trying to play a movie in a video game console and burning out the motor, buying a device that's specifically meant to handle the fast playback of DVD movies and television programs can give you a much better viewing experience. These machines are made to be incorporated with home entertainment systems, featuring a variety of connections to assist with hooking it into as complex or simplistic as your home system features. They also may be equipped also with high definition playback capable of 1080p upconversion, should your disc or television not be compatible with that function. Additionally, they can far exceed playback on a computer or laptop. While these devices are suited to running DVDs and stand less of a chance of being damaged by viewing, they are more limited by onboard graphics and sound cards, screen dimensions and usually diminutive speakers. There are also situations where a television and DVD player combination is necessary for playback. Region codes on certain disk and subtitle features would make the disk inoperable in most computers and gaming consoles, but a DVD player can handle the demand, if you purchase the right unit.

This makes it ideal for devices such as digital cameras where batteries go dead often. With being able to retain data even when power is lost you can rest assured that all your pictures will still be kept safe on the memory card. Examples of flash memory cards include Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, Compact Flash (CF) memory cards, and Sony's Memory Sticks (MS, M2, MS Duo, MS Pro, and MS Pro Duo) to name a few. Other examples of proprietary and permanent flash memory devices include memory cards for video gaming systems. The Benefits of Flash Memory Flash memory is extremely small, fast, lightweight, and makes no noise or have any moving parts, unlike hard drives. However, hard disks can hold considerably more data and its cost per megabyte is much cheaper although prices are quickly dropping as capacity grows larger for flash devices daily. Yet flash memory is quite reliable and allows you to specify which data you want to keep. USB flash drives are known as the floppy disks of the 21st century. You can see people walking around with them dangling from key chains, backpacks, and even around their necks. These are more resistant to physical abuse than the media cards used in digital cameras. They're also an improvement over optical storage like CDs and DVDs, which are easily scratched. Prices of the drives have come down so much that many companies give them to clients instead of printing reports and wasting paper and ink. In some schools, students are required to have them. At Newegg, we stock a wide variety of flash memory.

While tablets may be lighter, depending on the specific make and model, almost no device can match the functionality and convenience of a portable computer. Buying the right laptop accessories could create an even better user experience by making devices safer and supplementing the hardware. One of a laptop's biggest conveniences is its portability, but it can be awkward to carry in hand and doing so increases the odds of an accident - like being dropped on the sidewalk. A padded backpack can carry a laptop of any size while protecting the device from the elements. Laptop bags and cases are designed to absorb most bumps and bruises, so any valuables stored inside are less likely to be damaged during transit. You might also want to protect your laptop from potential thieves. Putting a lock on a computer would make it difficult for anyone to just walk away with it. Many laptops come with a security slot, so you might want to take advantage of it for additional security measures. Heavier users may find it difficult to find a device that can meet all their demands. A laptop battery can lose power quickly when the machine is asked to handle too many tasks at once. Sometimes there might not be an available outlet, so a power adapter is necessary to provide the extra juice needed to finish an important project before the charge dies. Additionally, most batteries last longer if a laptop does not overheat. Unfortunately, it's easy for a system's internal fan to be obstructed because they are mostly located on the bottom. A cooling pad could supplement a laptop's fans and prevent damage caused by excessive heat. Most of these devices connect via a USB port but have additional outlets so users can still connect flash drives with their computer while the cooling pad is working. Newegg is proud to offer a variety of laptop accessories, including laptop batteries, AC adapters, extended warranties, add-on cards, laptop bags and cases, hard drives, memory, networking devices, luggage & bags, replicators, docking stations and solid state disks.

Shoppers can find and choose the right Mac hard drive by thinking about storage and portability needs. To figure out what size hard drive you should buy, think about how much computing you do each day and how many files you save. If you're a heavy user, consider buying a drive with terabytes (TB) of available storage. You'll be able to save an entire system to a device with that much room, so if you need a new computer, you will be able to reinstall everything as it was previously. These units are beneficial to people who work in creative industries and have libraries that are too expansive for a single Mac external hard drive. For example, a photographer who has hundreds of thousands of pictures saved on his or her desktop won't be able to back everything up with a smaller unit. Casual consumers should consider drives with a few hundred gigabytes (GB) of space. Buying a device with TBs of data storage would result in a great deal of wasted space for users who only have a couple thousand files that need to be saved. If you plan on bringing your external Mac hard drive everywhere you go, you'll want to purchase a unit that is light and damage-resistant. Some drives are smaller than most tablets, while other devices are large enough to be confused with video game consoles. If you're prone to damaging your gadgets, consider a drive with pads and shock protectors to defend against significant bumps and bruises.

Attaching a device to a port replicator is a solution for those who need the extra outlets and hardware support. Port replicators connect to a laptop or tablet via the battery hook-up, so the peripheral acts as a base for the device. Some tablet stations include an external keyboard for consumers who don't like typing on the screen, while others may need extra USB slots to connect with other accessories.

Other models offer ethernet connections, USB ports and audio jacks but lack a disc reader. You can pick and choose which features you need to supplement your laptop's functionality. Port replicators can be quickly disconnected so a device is never tethered to a desk. Users can connect all peripheral devices, like external hard drives and printers, to a base so instead of unplugging multiple accessories only the docking station needs to be removed from a tablet or laptop.

Most people use their computers as gateways to the internet, so it can be frustrating if they can't go online because they can't find an ethernet cable. Consumers can buy wireless cards for laptops so their devices can connect with a signal from anywhere. These cards need to be installed to a computer's motherboard to use a wireless signal. Many of the available models come with tutorials and instruction guides, so even shoppers who aren't tech-savvy can easily install their new purchase. Laptop wireless cards act as internal receivers, allowing a computer to connect to the internet over the air without an ethernet cord. Users who are on the go need this added convenience so their devices can be fully functional anywhere there's a wireless signal. For example, college students can install a card so their laptops work in class and in the library - not just in their dorm rooms or apartments. A laptop must be within a certain proximity to a Wi-Fi router to receive the signal, as the card itself does not generate web connectivity. Fortunately, many establishments, ranging from coffee shops to public libraries, provide wireless web access, so everyone can find a place to go online. For users who want to add an ethernet connection to their notebook, there are cards with jacks for cords. Manufacturers have begun producing slim laptops that remove ethernet ports to reduce the devices' overall weight. Much like a wireless card, these units are installed internally but have an external attachment intended for a wired connection. You should make sure the wireless card you're thinking about purchasing matches your computer's hardware specifications. Access points must have driver support to function properly, so be sure to check what your system is capable of supporting.", "parent_text": "Ultrabook Accessories", "keyword_density": {"wireless": "2.2", "cards": "1.3", "laptop": "1.9", "wireless cards": "1.3", "laptop wireless cards": "1.0"}, "department_id": 2},

The console offers access to music, movies, sports, and, of course, video games. It may be a great media hub, but without the right peripheral devices it may be difficult to enjoy the 360's full potential. If you want to go online with the console you need a subscription to Xbox LIVE. The service is offered in monthly increments, so you can decide what time frame meets your needs to avoid wasteful spending on a subscription. If you want to buy any games, movies, or music from Microsoft's online store make sure you have plenty of Microsoft Points. Spare controllers are necessary for gamers who plan on playing with others. Rechargeable batteries and charging stations are available so gamers don't have to find a new pair of AA's every time power is running low. You could also replace the controller with your own movements by adding Kinect to your 360. Adding the motion sensor bar to the console gives you the ability to control your content with gestures and voice commands. While starting a movie by telling your Xbox to \"play disc\" may be convenient, playing games on Kinect may be awkward for some users who need an object to interact with and can't just act out certain activities. For example, a bowling ball replica may make bowling more fun and feel less like a game of charades. Make sure your device is well-connected with all the right wires and cords. Kinect's motion sensor can be moved further away from a television to prevent any motion-related accidents. Finally, don't forget an HDMI cable so all your favorite games, movies and shows are displayed in the highest possible picture quality.", "parent_text": "Video Game Console Accessories", "keyword_density": {"xbox 360": "0.7", "360": "1.0", "xbox": "1.0"}, "department_id": 6},

Consoles typically only come with one, so having extra controllers is necessary if you want to invite friends to play a game. You can pick and choose from numerous colors.

For people that use video services but have a hard time searching for movies and TV shows with the on-screen keyboard, there are external keyboards available. You won't have to navigate to different letters with the analog sticks after buying a mini-keyboard that syncs with your PS3. As the Blu-ray player was a major part of the PS3's appeal for many, a remote control may be more intuitive to use than controllers and make on-screen navigation much simpler. Additionally, movies will look even better with a HDMI cable for a higher resolution picture. For gamers who like to play online, a headset may be the perfect accessory to enhance the experience.

The units hold data and spin when users access their content. This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase. Some drives come bundled with instructional DVDs and manuals that guide amateurs through the installation process step-by-step so they don't accidentally damage their system. Upgrading to a solid state drive from a hard drive can make any computer more efficient and convenient to use.", "parent_text": "Ultrabook Accessories", "keyword_density": {"solid state": "1.3", "drives": "2.3", "solid state drives": "1.0"}, "department_id": 2},

Video card improvements move along at breakneck speeds - a new generation of video cards often replaces the old within 3-6 months.

Besides the GPU, the video memory specs (including video memory type, size and clock speed), interface (AGP or PCI Express), and I/O ports are should all be taken into account before purchasing a video card.

Whether you need speakers for the outdoors, a television room, or to hear your stereo throughout the house, you can find great audio equipment in our online catalog. As with all of our home electronics, our speakers are not only state of the art but also well-priced. You will not find superior value anywhere on the Internet. How to Choose Speakers The key to choosing the right speakers is understanding what the specifications mean. The most basic detail is the configuration, which is expressed as 2.0, 2.1, 4.1, and so on. The first digit refers to how many speakers come with the set, and the numeral to the right of the decimal point refers to how many subwoofers come with the system. A subwoofer provides a strong bass that many standard speakers are incapable of playing. Another factor to consider is sensitivity, which is measured in decibels (dB). Highly sensitive speakers (anything over 92 dB) can produce clear, high-volume sound without much amplifier power. Speakers with less than 88 dB are considered inefficient; sound will be distorted on these speakers without the help of a high-quality amplifier. Frequency response is also important. Ideally, you want speakers that can reproduce the entire spectrum of audible frequencies. The lowest frequency detectable by the human ear is 20 Hz, and the highest is 20,000 Hz, or 20 kHz. If speakers cannot play something as low as 20 Hz, the only way to hear everything you are supposed to hear is by purchasing a subwoofer. What about Watts?Unless you plan on hosting a heavy metal concert in your backyard, you will probably never blow your speakers regardless of the amplifier you use. Distortion causes blown speakers far more often than volume. To avoid blown speakers, never exceed the recommended wattage on your amplifiers. This will prevent distortion. By playing music at a comfortable listening level without distortion, your speakers will be just fine.

Fans of first-person shooters or similarly combat-heavy games will certainly have plenty of options on their hands. As far as genres go, these action-packed titles run the gamut from Renaissance-era swashbuckling and sci-fi dystopia to modern warfare and crime sagas. Additionally, intense role-playing games (RPGs) and real-time strategy (RTS) titles are available. Options in this category include games from established franchises like Diablo, Starcraft and Age of Empires to newer favorite series such as Fallout and The Elder Scrolls. However, those games aren't for everyone, and some are rated either T for Teen or M for Mature - intended for adults and teenagers of a certain age and maturity level. Parents, never fear - we've got plenty of other options for younger gamers and those uninterested in combat. These also encompass a wide variety of genres, as you could be creating entire new worlds in games like The Sims, planning culinary domination in Restaurant Empire or testing your wits with puzzle- and gambling-themed titles. You'll even have no trouble finding sports games or options that are suitable for even the youngest players.

It may be beneficial to have a mount that charges a smartphone during long rides. Other models sync with a vehicle's sound system so that the iPhone's playback features can be used to replace the radio. Consider your needs before buying the perfect mount.

The cases also protect smartphones from damage like scratches, cracks and chips. Alternatively, you could buy a mobile charger that runs on AA batteries. It can be inconvenient to have to charge your phone and a backup power source, so having a charger that runs on affordable batteries could be a simpler solution.

It's easy to operate these switches, it's a snap to throw these together and quickly expand your network. Network switches have long been generally compatible with 10/100 networks, which are sufficient for most home or small office networks, to bring you error-free data transactions. Gigabit network switches are available for even faster tranfer rates, and as more computers come standard with gigabit network cards a faster switch may be a quick and easy upgrade to your network that will show immediate results. Transmit Faster with Wired Network Switches Private consumers like switches as well, as they offer an effective way to transfer and transmit data, video, and audio files. If you're an online gaming aficionado, for instance, you might use a switch to improve your gaming experience. Switches generally accept crossover cables and so-called straight cables. Thus, you don't have to shop for any particular connector to get started with data switching.", "parent_text": "Servers & Workstations", "keyword_density": {"switches": "4.1", "network": "5.1", "network switches": "4.6"}, "department_id": 1},

A rubber sleeve or a rigid shell can keep a mobile device working like new, even if it's frequently dropped. No two covers are exactly alike, and it's a shopper's responsibility to decide what type of protection is best for a smartphone. Sleeves are best suited to protect your phone's display and bezel from scuffs. The thin rubber layers are durable and don't add much weight, so your mobile device will still be convenient to use. Hard shells are designed to secure your phone's internal components during accidents. The rigid cases ensure that hardware won't be jostled or fall out of place and add additional heft to smartphones that feel flimsy. You should also consider finding a cover that protects your screen. The Otterbox Defender series for the iPhone 5 has a plastic shield to prevent dust particles from scratching the screens. In addition, other iPhone 5 cases are bundled with screen covers that you can install. Different cases may be more convenient for different situations. If you don't like carrying your phone in your pocket or bag, covers with belt clips are available. There are armbands that protect your device during your workout. You should also consider different aesthetics when it comes to your case. Your phone should be as fashionable as it is functional, and you can find sleeves with unique designs that suit your tastes. For instance, you can buy a solid black sleeve to give your device a sleek look. Of course, the most important consideration you should make is whether your smartphone will fit inside the case. If your protective sleeve isn't the proper size, your device may be damaged. Additionally, manufacturers install button covers for different phones, so some features may be inaccessible if you buy the wrong case.", "parent_text": "Cell Phones", "keyword_density": {"mobile": "0.6", "phone": "3.5", "cases": "0.9", "covers": "1.3"}, "department_id": 7},

The machines require constant care and maintenance to function properly, and even the most vigilant users can run into problems. Electrical issues can be devastating - whether it's a power outage that causes work to be lost, a blown fuse that shuts the system down or anything in between. An uninterrupted power supply prevents disruptions from electrical malfunctions. While the devices don't hold a long-lasting charge, users will have enough time to save files and properly turn off a computer to avoid any damage or find and activate an alternate power source. Unlike a generator, there is no lag time between a loss of power and activation with UPS power supplies. The back-ups store electricity that is immediately shared with any connected computer when primary power is lost. This prevents system damage by avoiding sudden changes in voltage. Hard drives can be damaged by electrical losses and surges. UPS battery backups maintain a steady rate of power for a computer and can extend the life of any piece of equipment by eliminating the long-term harm electrical fluctuations can cause. Shoppers should consider their needs when researching a UPS device. Some back-up systems last longer than others, which would be better for users who don't have an alternate power source available. Consumers who have a secondary electrical supply should buy a device that lasts long enough to activate the other power source. If you're worried about the longevity of the UPS, there are models with screens and diagnostic tools. You'll be able to monitor the health of the device and avoid wearing the system out by overloading it.

They are the circuitry involved in running hard disks and getting them to do what they are supposed to. On IDE drives, the hard drive controller is actually part of the drive. In older hard drives, controllers were separate boards. With a typical IDE hard drive, you can have up to four devices directly connected to the motherboard. An example would be the hard drive, floppy drive, CD-ROM, and DVD drives. If all the spots are used up, you would need to purchase another hard drive controller card. Sometimes the hard drive controller can fail and you will need to replace it. You need the same type of controller as your hard drive. For example, IDE drives are only compatible with IDE controllers, and SCSI drives need SCSI controllers. Hard Drive Controller Errors If you get an error that says \"HDD controller failure\" upon booting your computer, it usually means the hard disk drive (HDD) controller has failed. Sometimes, you will get a 1701 error, which means the hard drive controller and the drive are having trouble communicating. This might be due to a loose connection. The best way to avoid losing data is to prevent loss by backing up. With the low cost of external hard drives this is a ideal solution. By making regular copies of your important files, or by cloning your entire hard drive setup, you'll save yourself a ton of trouble in the event that your hard drive ever goes bad.

All those threats. All those data security issues. You want the cloud, but you're afraid of DropBox, and that's understandable, but you want your own cloud. In a world where we can have everything customized, from our electronics to our cars, pets, homes, clothes and our own bodies, there's no reason you can't have a storage solution that's as cheap, effective and accessible as the cloud without worrying about someone else's terms of service or use agreements. That's why network attached storage is such a handy product for those in the know. Network-attached storage (NAS) is data storage or a data storage device, such as a hard drive or RAID array, connected to a computer network, providing data access to different network clients. When you have a few computers working in tandem, it's essential that they have access to the same collaborative tools and files necessary to get projects completed. An enterprise-level solution like NAS gives all these machines access to the same documents whenever they need, so long as they can access the network. Wired or wireless options are possible with network attached storage. Wi-Fi capable, internet-ready and able to house a few disks worth of data (which you'll likely have to buy separately), these can be isolated from the online world if you so choose, or made accessible if you see fit. They allow not only sharing of key information but also devices like scanners, printers and fax machines. NAS Systems NAS systems contain one or more hard disks, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID arrays (redundant arrays of inexpensive/independent disks). NAS devices remove the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. NAS provides both storage and file systems. This is often contrasted with SAN (Storage Area Network) devices, which provide only block-based storage and leaves filesystem concerns on the \"client\" side. SAN protocols include SCSI, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet, or HyperSCSI. Flexibility & Scalability Fit for personal or small business use, network attached storage is flexible, scalable and ready for whatever in-house storage and devices you can throw at it. Reasonably priced, they even outmatch some online vendor contracts and can outlast an outage, too. Newegg has Network storage / NAS from the world\u2019s best Network storage / NAS manufacturers, including Buffalo, Cavalry, D-Link, Hammer Storage, Intel, iomega, LaCie, Linksys, Maxtor, Netgear, QNAP, Thecus, Western Digital and Synology.", "parent_text": "Servers & Workstations", "keyword_density": {"network": "2.6", "network attached storage": "2.8", "storage nas": "1.4", "storage": "3.5", "nas": "1.9", "network attached storage nas": "0.9"}, "department_id": 1},

However, not all PCs come equipped with sound cards that can produce the type of audio you want. If you use a computer as a home theater, music player, or gaming system, it is ideal to have the capability for 5.1 surround sound. 5.1 means there are five speakers and one subwoofer. Sound cards send different audio signals to each of the five speakers, so the speakers all play a different portion of the overall sound. Rather than simply hearing the audio from a computer, a listener becomes immersed in whatever is playing. This intensifies the video gaming experience and enhances your enjoyment of music and movies. Sound Card Features to Look for If you plan on using a computer to record or play music, consider purchasing a sound card with MIDI. MIDI is a standard for connecting electronic musical instruments. Having MIDI is especially helpful to musicians who like to write and record their own songs. With the right software programs and a sound card with MIDI, it is possible for one musician to play five different instruments (one at a time) and then overlap the recordings together to make one song on the computer. Other important sound card specifications include whether or not the card has a microphone plug, and the operating systems that can read the card. It is especially important to check this latter detail if you are using an older operating system. Some of the newer sound cards only work with newer operating systems. Here at Newegg, we have dozens of sound cards that can transform your computer into a state-of-the-art stereo system. Our electronics are sold at discounted prices, so you will find quality products at great values on our website.", "parent_text": "Soundcards, Speakers & Headsets", "keyword_density": {"sound": "3.7", "sound cards": "3.3"}, "department_id": 1},

To get the best possible performance for streaming movies and video playback, as well as in-game audio experiences, it's essential that you get the best computer speakers to round out your machine. A standard set of side-by-side speakers will let you hear what's happening more clearly than using an onboard sound device. Without a tool like this, you may not get any audio with your playback at all, so this should be considered a basic purchase to go along with upgrading a keyboard and mouse. If you want a real experience with your media, try purchasing a heftier system. Something with a subwoofer and additional high-powered speakers can make it feel like you have a surround sound experience in your computer chair. Purchasing a speaker system also means considering how these will be connected. Some systems have USB hook-ups or other plugs and cables that won't require as many dedicated sockets, but there are expanders and other solutions to increase the maximum number of USB devices you can have going at once. Some devices will also be able to pull power right from the computer they're attached to, but in some cases they have a dedicated power supply that will need its own wall outlet. You may need to buy a separate power strip on top of speakers to make sure the entire system will function correctly. Buying the best computer speakers will ensure high-quality gaming and viewing from your machine. While devices come equipped in some cases with onboard sound capability, these tools can't compare to a system of computer speakers.", "parent_text": "Soundcards, Speakers & Headsets", "keyword_density": {"speakers": "1.9", "computer": "1.9", "computer speakers": "1.9"}, "department_id": 1},

Video card improvements move along at breakneck speeds - a new generation of video cards often replaces the old within 3-6 months. The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) basically determines the features (e.g. DirectX/OpenGL, HDR, and SLI or CrossFire) and performance level of a video card.

This means consumers won't be able to fit their new iPhone in the same case as their old phone. There are two types of iPhone 5 cases to choose from - hard shells and soft body gloves. Both protect the device and help prevent any bumps and bruises from an accidental fall. Solid cases are slightly heavier than gel ones, but you may want the extra weight so your iPhone doesn't feel so fragile. You should pick the iPhone 5 cover that feels the most comfortable and unobtrusive when using your phone. Enclosures are available in almost every color as well, so your phone can look as good as it works. Gym-goers may want to buy an armband for extra security during a workout. It could be easy for an iPhone to slide out of your pocket while on the bench, and not even the best case could save it from being stepped on. Joggers may find it annoying to have their arms tangled with their headphones' wire extending all the way down to their pocket, but an armband could help avoid unwanted fuss during that last mile. The iPhone's new 4-inch screen has a gorgeous display, so it's important to protect the glass from any damage. A screen protector is a wise investment for all smartphone users who want to avoid small scratches all over their devices.

These types of headphones can be especially useful during workouts when annoying cords can hinder certain motions. Bluetooth speakers allow you to play your favorite songs from your mobile device without having to leave it on a dock or tether it to your stereo. Simply pair your sound system with your smartphone and you can fill any room with your music.

As such, we always make sure to keep this pocket-sized console in stock - in all of its affordably priced models. Also similar to the DS, is the Wii U , the next gen Nintendo console which allows for dual-screen gaming as well. Models of the DS (with the exception of the DS Lite) range from 3.25 to 4.2 inches in terms of screen width. While this is certainly small, visibility is never a struggle, and it provides remarkable clarity and graphic quality despite its compact dimensions. Newer versions of the DS feature the stock Camera and Sound applications, which make on-the-go photography, music and sound recording a breeze. Some models also include pre-installed software such as Brain Age and Photo Clock. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the device's Wi-Fi readiness. With the addition of an expansion pack (to allow for the necessary extra memory), the DS allows you to surf the web in between games - or, in some instances, during games, to interact with other users or access exclusive content. As far as controls are concerned, you'll notice a great deal of flexibility with the Nintendo DS. In addition to the standard buttons, certain games and functions allow you to take advantage of the touch-screen stylus that comes with the console. For the games and applications that use it, this option provides notable ease of use and plenty of fun. Another one of the DS' greatest attributes is the wide spectrum of games available. No matter what you're into as a gamer - racing games, first-person shooters, puzzles, sports games or fantasy based RPGs - chances are good you'll be able to find something to your liking. We have many of the console's new and classic titles in stock, so take a look today and let your gaming experience begin!", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"nintendo ds": "1.2", "ds": "2.4", "nintendo": "0.9"}, "department_id": 6},

Peripheral devices can make the Wii even more fun to use. You can buy fishing rods and bowling balls that you can connect with your remote so you can truly mimic the actions of going out on the lake or throwing a strike. There are even steering wheels that can make driving in games like \"Mario Kart\" feel as natural as it does in your own vehicle. Gamers who aren't fans of the Nintendo Wii's motion controls can buy traditional controllers. All of the Wii's games have secondary commands that allow players to use other devices, including those from the Nintendo GameCube, when they want to play with their friends locally. The Wii also boasts a massive library of exceptional titles. Every console comes bundled with \"Wii Sports,\" which went from a technical demonstration to one of Nintendo's biggest hits. The game features boxing, bowling, baseball, tennis and golf and teaches players how to use the motion controls. Nintendo also brought back fan-favorite characters like Mario, Kirby and Donkey Kong. Nintendo also brought in third-party publishers to produce some of the Wii's best games. You can find popular franchises with titles like \"LEGO: Lord of the Rings\" and \"FIFA Soccer 13.\" The Nintendo Wii is fun for gamers of all ages and has a roster of kid-friendly titles as well as some geared toward older players.

The console was the first to feature motion controls, allowing gamers' gestures to control the on-screen action instead of traditional button commands. In November Nintendo will unveil the Wii's successor - Wii U. One of the most notable updates the gaming giant has included is a larger controller. The previous generation of the console featured a motion-sensing controller with a detachable analog stick. The Nintendo Wii U uses a large GamePad. The controller has all the standard buttons and navigational tools, but also features a touchscreen display and a camera. For gamers who don't want to learn how to use a new controller, the Wii U Pro Controller is a more traditional peripheral, as it has no screen. If you want to use the GamePad, you'll have to keep it charged. Batteries die quickly and it can be annoying to tether your controller to the console. Despite this, the GamePad Stand/Cradle keeps your controller alive, so you don't have to worry about it dying in the middle of a game. While the Wii U offers a host of features, including popular streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, the games are the main attractions. As has been the case with previous Nintendo console releases, there is a new \"Super Mario Bros.\" title debuting alongside the Wii U. There's also \"Nintendo Land Wii U,\" a game that demonstrates all of the Wii U's new features through mini games, much like \"Wii Sports\" for the Wii. Gamers aren't limited to Nintendo-produced titles either, as two massive franchises are coming to the Wii U. \"Call of Duty: Black Ops II\" and \"Rayman Legends\" are both the latest installments of popular series with two entirely different styles of game play.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"u": "15.3", "wii u": "5.2", "wii": "3.9"}, "department_id": 6},

The Nintendo 3DS only widens the gap between handheld gaming systems and smartphones. Nintendo's latest mobile gadget continues the manufacturer's popular series that has included groundbreaking devices like the GameBoy and GameBoy Color. Unlike previous models, the 3DS features two screens and a flip cover to protect both displays from damage. Most games use the smaller screen as a map, leaving the main action to take place on the larger one. Both displays include 3D graphics that you can customize. The handheld includes a switch that allows you to increase and decrease the graphic quality on both screens. At its highest level, the 3DS can compete with most in-home 3D televisions in terms of clarity and performance. As a result of the strong graphics, many of the games available for the 3DS are comparable to those found on consoles like the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 . Many titles are available for the device so gamers can play their favorite games on-the-go. Additionally, there are exclusives like \"Rayman Origins\" and the video game adaption of the popular cartoon \"Adventure Time\" that are only available for the 3DS. Accessories can make gaming even more enjoyable on the handheld. For instance, there's a case modeled after a steering wheel so you can pretend you're really driving when playing racing games. Other cases might not be as suited to gaming, but they can protect your 3DS while making it very stylish. Metallic cases can protect your handheld from accidental drops, while silicone sleeves are equally durable and don't add unnecessary bulk to your 3DS.

With streaming services, a built-in Blu-ray player and internet connectivity, there are plenty of ways you can stay entertained with Sony's console. Picking out the right PS3 accessories can create an even better experience while using the device, by enhancing all of its best features. A controller is a basic necessity for every user. Consoles typically only come with one, so having extra controllers is necessary if you want to invite friends to play a game. You can pick and choose from numerous colors. Don't forget to buy a charger, as well. PS3s sync with new controllers via the wired connection, and without it, once a battery dies it's dead for good. For people that use video services but have a hard time searching for movies and TV shows with the on-screen keyboard, there are external keyboards available. You won't have to navigate to different letters with the analog sticks after buying a mini-keyboard that syncs with your PS3. As the Blu-ray player was a major part of the PS3's appeal for many, a remote control may be more intuitive to use than controllers and make on-screen navigation much simpler. Additionally, movies will look even better with a HDMI cable for a higher resolution picture. For gamers who like to play online, a headset may be the perfect accessory to enhance the experience. You can use this tool to strategize with teammates or psych out an opponent during a heated basketball or football game. Buying the right PlayStation 3 accessories can make the console even more fun to use and enhance all your favorite features.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"ps3": "1.3", "ps3 accessories": "0.7", "accessories": "0.7"}, "department_id": 6},

Many electronic items from televisions to game consoles require a web signal to reach the device's true potential. Unfortunately not every home has Wi-Fi available and not every room has a phone jack, limiting the number of gadgets that can access the internet. It can be expensive and time consuming to run additional ethernet cables through walls so each device has access to the internet. A powerline adapter could be the cost-effective solution homeowners are looking for to make their web connection available all over their house. An internet connection can be shared via existing wires with powerline networking. Simply plugging an adapter into an outlet near the web signal's origin point and then putting additional adapters in other rooms allows homeowners to bring web access to their entire house. For example, if an internet router is in the kitchen it wouldn't be possible to go online in any other room via a wired connection. A power adapter basically turns an outlet into an internet router so you can play video games online in your bedroom. Every room has an electrical outlet, but phone jacks are probably in one or two places. These adapters create a whole new network in a home without running wires all through a residence. This could be convenient to consumers who move frequently, like college students, and don't want to pay for an installation that they won't use for too long. Powerline networking allows consumers to make the most of every device that can access web content. Instead of paying for an expensive wireless connection from an internet provider, shoppers can install the adapters themselves and enjoy all the best features of their favorite gadgets. Shoppers should consider all their options when configuring their internet connection, but powerline networking could be the most convenient solution.", "parent_text": "Networking", "keyword_density": {"powerline": "1.3", "powerline networking": "1.9"}, "department_id": 1},

These devices bring us television, internet, news and entertainment. Depending on the strength and caliber of the device, these signals can be boosted or hobbled, so buying a good modem can bring you a better media experience. There is a variety of services available that provide internet and other media to home and professional users, but the boxes they provide usually aren't the top of the line. A standard modem will carry a 6MHz signal just fine, but upstream data won't travel as well from a sub-par device as it could from some of the top models. Cable modems work best for those receiving their service through a television or multi-service provider, though in some cases a DSL modem is necessary. These carry TV, internet and even phone with a single connection, and the higher the demand for a device, the stronger it needs to be. Some of the best modems offer up to 24Mbps download speed with 2Mbps upload streams as well. All providers will carry a slower upload speed, regardless of brand or carrier, as it's largely assumed that we're downloading a significant amount more than we're sending back to the web. That speeds up the process, though, making room for the utility most users want most. These devices also will usually have at least one Ethernet port, though some are USB compatible. LED lights on the exterior of the case aren't standard, but purchasing a modem with this feature will help assist with diagnostic tests if a problem should arise.

Even wireless devices need to recharge from time to time, and only solar-powered technology can run without being anchored occasionally to a power source. With so many devices demanding electrical attention, there just aren't enough outlets in any given home to accommodate all of them. That's why power strips are so essential. Any computer, home entertainment system or kitchen appliance will need one or more sockets for each device incorporated in a suite of tools. Some may need a half dozen or more just to achieve basic functionality. Power strips take a single wall outlet and turn it into a hub for devices, providing 2 or 3 extra sockets for extension cord models, or upwards of 10 to 12 for high-traffic areas. Some of these are also outfitted with surge protectors and backup power alerts. These strips will automatically switch off if they detect a jump in electrical current, protecting all devices attached to it. Others will also supply a small amount of energy for a short period and issue an audible chime to alert people nearby that an event has occurred and power needs to be restored. Other safety features also include protective caps to prevent accidental electrocution from an exposed socket, which is great for households with pets or small children. These tools can also help save on your electricity bill. Instead of struggling to manually unplug and reconnect each device when you aren't using it, you can simply flip the power switch on the strip and turn everything off or back on again at once. Power strips are safe, versatile and provide necessary electricity to all the utilities in your home. Be it for recreation or practical use, they are a reliable way of multiplying the number of things you can do in any given room.", "parent_text": "Power Protection", "keyword_density": {"strips": "1.3", "power strips": "1.9", "power": "2.6"}, "department_id": 1},

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal. The DVI connector is mainstream equipment on newer video cards and on an increasing number of new LCD monitors. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors are necessary for displays with HD resolution approaching that of HDTV, from 720-1080 lines per frame, and they're backwards-compatible with DVI systems.

End-users would then access the wireless LAN through the wireless network adapters in their computers. Wireless Network Adapters Every network adapter supports either Wi-Fi (wireless) or Ethernet (wired) standards. At Newegg, we stock both types of network adapters so you can get what you need whether your network is wired or wireless. Wireless networks can be less expensive to implement than wired networks, because there is less labor and fewer materials involved. Schools and nonprofits tend to benefit from these cost savings, and they're becoming increasingly popular with multiple-computer households.. They're simple to install and can reach places that might be difficult to wire. If you're in a temporary space, their portability is an asset. You can use a mobile router to connect to a wired LAN and to anyone in your company who is networked. Wireless LANs are also very scalable, so you can build on if you need to connect several buildings. You simply add more access points and wireless network adapters. Improvements in data transfer rates (802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g and the newer 802.11n) mean you are getting networking speed rivaling your wired networks.

Every one of them, from tablets to game consoles, requires a strong signal to work at maximum capacity. If your wireless connection is weak, the devices may not work well and you won''''t be able to enjoy all of your favorite features. Some houses may be too large for a standard router to supply sufficient coverage over the entire area. A wireless repeater could boost the signal strength to make sure that even the furthest corners are covered. A wireless signal degrades as it travels through the air. As a computer or tablet is moved further away from the Wi-Fi origin point, the strength of the internet connection will decrease. A wireless range extender gives the signal another broadcast point for an increase in strength over a larger area. Most of these extenders practically double the range of coverage. Every room in the house will have a strong wireless signal, so devices can be brought anywhere without fear of losing the connection. Instead of being forced to stay close to your wireless router to stream a movie on your laptop, you could go upstairs without dealing with constant pauses while the file loads over a weak signal. No matter where you are, you''''ll be to go online quickly and not worry about leaving the network area. Different range extenders are available based on your connection needs. Some modems plug directly into the wall, so they''''re perfect for a house that doesn''''t have a lot of shelf space. Other repeaters have long cords, so they don''''t have to be too close to an outlet to work. Boosting your wireless signal has never been easier.

If a space is too large or has too many barriers, an internet signal can fail to reach far-flung devices. A network degrades as it travels over the air, so a wall can prevent a computer from connecting to a router. Setting up a wireless access point creates a new source for a wireless signal, so that every Wi-Fi enabled gadget can go online successfully. The device acts as a bridge for the internet connection so it can cover a larger area without losing strength. An access point syncs with a wireless router to rebroadcast the signal it receives. Unlike a PC, which needs to be near a modem for a fast internet connection, a wireless bridge has a direct connection to the Wi-Fi router so it can be far enough away to increase the coverage area. Some devices cannot support local gadgets and require an additional ethernet port to allow wireless devices to go online. These models are usually smaller so you aren't losing much additional space because of the second unit. For offices and workspaces, there are access points that can be mounted to the wall or ceiling and don't have to sit on an employee's desk.

The computer keyboard is an input device that sends commands and text inputs to the computer, and is the main interface that we use to communicate or control the computer in combination with the mouse. Unfortunately, not every computer's keyboard is comfortable and sturdy. Without these two characteristics, productivity may decline as working becomes a hassle and can even be painful. You may believe that your typing technique requires improvement, but more often than not faulty hardware is the root of your discomfort. Not every model has wrist supports and you can hurt your arms while you type without assistance. Ergonomic keyboards are designed to help you use your computer without any pain. These models have larger bases, letting you rest your wrists and palms while typing. Instead of uncomfortably hovering over your keyboard, your hands have the necessary support to prevent any strain and reduce the likelihood of developing physical ailments like carpal tunnel syndrome. Pads are commonly found on gaming keyboards as those are meant for more casual use. During a marathon game session, players must usually enter a great deal of key commands. With a standard keyboard, this can lead to pain or discomfort, as their hands continually move without support or rest. Some gaming models, by contrast, have features that can improve a gamer's performance as well. Wireless keyboards are also available - these ensure that users aren't tethered to their desks. If you have a large enough screen, you can use your device while sitting away from your computer. Working without wires also allows you to find a relaxed position, so you aren't confined to a single table. Buying a new keyboard can improve your typing proficiency, whether you're writing a term paper or playing a video game. The right device can raise your comfort levels while also making it easier to use your computer through key commands. Brands featured at Newegg include Microsoft, KeyTronic, Adesso, Logitech and many others.

These are great to have when traveling abroad, too. If you should happen to need a secure link to personal data, are operating outside your network range or should lose your valuables, you can keep a flash drive handy containing ID and serial numbers for personal devices. To ensure this information isn't stolen as well, having a locked flash drive can keep anyone from viewing your files should the drive fall into the wrong hands. Tiny and portable, they easily slip into a pants or coat pocket, in a computer bag or purse, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. External keypads add an additional level of security to portable memory, meaning a viewer must first input a numerical code to gain access to files. These in turn can be encrypted and password protected, deterring serious threats to personal security. Flash drives are also cost-effective. You can securely store a few dozen gigabytes of data for less than $30, and these devices range in storage capacity, price and overall size - equal to the amount you're willing to invest. Some even have special features like lanyards, locks, belt clips and key fobs to make them easier to carry and keep track of.

Usually a Macbook Pro will give you two slots for additional memory and various other machines like the Mini and PowerMac may have explicit preferences, so optimizing this space is crucial. When shopping for upgrades, look for models that offer heat spreaders and lower tRas values. These features mean lower likelihood of overheating if you try to further modify your Mac, and even if you leave your Mac RAM as the manufacturer intended, a low tRas means faster operating speeds. Also, Macbook Pro owners should watch out for XMP-restricted RAM - this stuff will only function at 1333MHz, so you may not want to pay more for something that doesn't work the way you want it to. With the right tweaking, you can get your laptop functioning almost at the same capacity as a desktop model without spending nearly the same amount of money. For optimal output and performance make sure you check first and see what kind of memory your Mac uses. For every kind of Apple product there are corresponding limits on the amount and kinds of memory that will work for your machine, and it's important not to damage your computer in the process of upgrading.

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal. The DVI connector is mainstream equipment on newer video cards and on an increasing number of new LCD monitors. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors are necessary for displays with HD resolution approaching that of HDTV, from 780-1080 lines per inch, and they're backwards-compatible with DVI systems.", "parent_text": "Monitors", "keyword_density": {"lcd": "3.0", "monitors": "2.4", "lcd monitors": "3.5"}, "department_id": 1},

The definition of the word \"memory\" has become somewhat blurred over the years because there are different types of memory that a computer uses. In general, \"memory\" refers to the system memory, or RAM, which holds instructions that the processor uses, and the data the instructions work with. System memory is directly related to the performance of your computer. In some ways, it's even more important than the processor, because without enough memory, your processor cannot work to its full potential. Newer programs require more memory than older ones, so when buying a new computer, get the most memory that you can afford. Learn about Types of System Memory There are many different types of system memory available. Researching them will help you make an informed choice when you purchase your computer. Getting the right kind of memory for your system will also affect whether you can upgrade it later on, and by how much.

The iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 , Samsung Galaxy S3 and Sony Xperia S can all be obtained without having to sign up with a new carrier. Once you find the perfect device, you simply find your coverage provider's signal and tune your phone to its frequency. You can also find phones that are no longer manufactured. Instead of limiting yourself to touchscreen devices, you can find feature phones and QWERTY models that have been discontinued. Many of these phones are new so you don't have to worry about using a refurbished or damaged device. Unlocked phones can access most major carriers. Changing companies can help save you money by avoiding roaming charges while traveling abroad or out of your local coverage area. Additionally, you can bring your device anywhere instead of buying a new phone whenever you move to a location that isn't supported by your company. Unlocking your phone manually can be difficult. Without the proper training and technical skill, you can damage your phone and prevent it from working properly. Buying an unlocked phone eliminates all of the hassles so you can immediately begin using your device.", "parent_text": "Cell Phones", "keyword_density": {"phones": "2.1", "unlocked": "2.1"}, "department_id": 7},

Sony's handheld device shares some options with the PlayStation 3 so players can enjoy their favorite games both at home and on the go. The PSP features popular cross-platform and exclusive titles. Publishers produce mobile versions of installments from fan-favorite franchises like \"Ratchet & Clank,\" \"Grand Theft Auto\" and \"SOCOM.\" The handheld produces strong graphic quality so that the games are as visually lush as they are on the PS3 , thanks to a strong internal processor and LCD screen. Some games resemble older handheld titles with modern twists. For example, traditional side-scrolling titles have difficult puzzles and challenges that might be more challenging than collecting coins and saving princesses. There are also digital versions of traditional board games like chess that allow players to connect with opponents online so they can play their friends rather than the computer. Playing video games can quickly drain the PlayStation Portable's battery. Fortunately, there are plenty of accessories that can recharge the battery or make the power last longer. A travel charger is a necessity for every gamer that takes their PSP on the go. Additionally, an AC adapter that connects to a car could be perfect for shoppers who want to keep their handhelds alive during long drives. You won't always be near an outlet, however, so it's always a good idea to have a backup battery. If you don't want to manually replace your battery, an external power source can keep your PSP charged for hours. The mobile chargers are perfect for marathon gaming sessions when you can't turn your PSP off without losing your current session.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"playstation": "1.0", "playstation portable": "1.4"}, "department_id": 6},

A major feature that distinguishes the PlayStation 3 from its predecessors is it's unified online gaming service, the PlayStation Network, which contrasts with Sony's former policy of relying on game developers for online play. Other major features of the console include its robust multimedia capabilities, connectivity with the PlayStation Portable, and its use of a high-definition optical disc format, Blu-ray Disc, as its primary storage medium. The PS3 was also the first Blu-ray 2.0-compliant Blu-ray player on the market. PS3 Games Imagine you own a PlayStation 3. It plays movies, connects to the internet, lets you hang out and chat with your friends and gives you Hulu and Netflix at the touch of a button. But let's be honest, you didn't buy it to play downloadable games or shoot the breeze with your friends. You're looking to shoot aliens, storm castles, explore unknown lands and have silly, wacky adventures. For that you're going to need some PS3 games. If you've walked into a game store recently you've probably noticed there are hundreds of titles to choose from, and walking in circles and staring at the walls isn't the best way to find out more about a title. Box art may look cool, but it won't necessarily give you information on HUD interfaces, gameplay graphics or continuity of storyline. Deciding on a genre is always a great place to start. First-person shooters, role playing, driving, action, adventure, horror, strategy, sports and fighting titles from various game studios are out in force. That's right, you also have to decide if you like Rockstar to Konami, EA over Activision, or Square Enix more than Namco. One of the other things to take into account is the rating. Not everyone wants to see blood and gore, but some gamers like the realistic intensity of games with more mature ratings. When buying as a gift, it may not be the best decision to buy an M-rated game, so be mindful of the ESRB's handy guidelines while selecting your games. Purchasing PS3 games can take a little time, but usually it will be love at first sight. Go with your gut, pick a genre and a plotline you love, and sit down for hours of quality time with your PlayStation once you have all the PS3 games to rock it with.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"playstation": "2.1", "3": "2.3", "playstation 3": "1.8"}, "department_id": 6},

The console offers access to music, movies, sports, and, of course, video games. It may be a great media hub, but without the right peripheral devices it may be difficult to enjoy the 360's full potential. If you want to go online with the console you need a subscription to Xbox LIVE. The service is offered in monthly increments, so you can decide what time frame meets your needs to avoid wasteful spending on a subscription. If you want to buy any games, movies, or music from Microsoft's online store make sure you have plenty of Microsoft Points. Spare controllers are necessary for gamers who plan on playing with others. Rechargeable batteries and charging stations are available so gamers don't have to find a new pair of AA's every time power is running low. You could also replace the controller with your own movements by adding Kinect to your 360. Adding the motion sensor bar to the console gives you the ability to control your content with gestures and voice commands. While starting a movie by telling your Xbox to \"play disc\" may be convenient, playing games on Kinect may be awkward for some users who need an object to interact with and can't just act out certain activities. For example, a bowling ball replica may make bowling more fun and feel less like a game of charades. Make sure your device is well-connected with all the right wires and cords. Kinect's motion sensor can be moved further away from a television to prevent any motion-related accidents.

Instead of button commands and joystick rotations, players can run, dance or perform any movement to control their avatars. All the Xbox's games are even more entertaining when played online.

On it rests the documents you create, the music you listen to, the games you play and the video you view. You'll want to choose a drive which is optimized for your primary purpose. There are a few main things to consider when selecting a hard drive: internal or external hard drive, connection type, speed and capacity. Whether you call it a Hard Drive, a Hard Disk, or an HDD, budget permitting, always go for the fastest drive you can. Speed of data access is measured using RPMs (revolutions per minute). Typical drives range from 5400 to 7200 RPM, with more and more 9600 RPM drive appearing on the scene. A faster rotational speed means greater performance, especially in games, but may cause greater heat and noise. The capacity, measured in GB (gigabytes), should depend on your own storage requirements. A higher capacity drive will invariably cost more than a smaller drive, so a balance must usually be struck between capacity and cost. The hard drive interface, whether it's IDE, SATA, or SCSI determine a drive's application: IDE and SATA for personal storage and SCSI for enterprise and mission critical storage. Please see our Internal Hard Drive Buying Guide for more information. ATA/IDE Whether you call it \"Advanced Technology Attachment\" or \"Integrated Drive Electronics\", the name given to it by Western Digital, this connection method has the drive controller integrated into the drive, rather than connected to the motherboard. They can communicate at up to 133 MB/s. SATA 1.5 Gbit/s First-generation SATA interfaces, also known as SATA/150 or unofficially as SATA 1, communicate at a rate of 150MB/s or 1.5 Gbit/s. SATA 3.0 Gbit/s Soon after SATA 1.5 Gbit/s introduction a number of shortcomings were observed. This feature, Native Command Queuing (NCQ), was adopted as an optional supported feature for SATA 1.5 Gbit/s and SATA 3.0 Gbit/s devices. SATA 3.0 Gbit/s is designed to fall back to SATA 1.5 Gbit/s when in communication with these older devices. In practice, some older SATA controllers do not properly implement SATA speed negotiation. SATA cables are less expensive and more compact than for ATA. With the introduction of SATA, convention ATA is sometimes called Parallel ATA (PATA), which refers to the method in which the data travels over the wires. SATA 6.0 Gbit/s Over the years the industry has increased bus bandwidth from PATA through SATA 1.5 Gb/s and SATA 3 Gb/s to keep up with the demand for higher transfer rates. The next evolution of bus bandwidth has now been achieved with the introduction of SATA 6 Gb/s, (SATA 3.0). This transition to a SATA 6 Gb/s interface aligns with the introduction of SATA 6 Gb/s-supporting chip sets and motherboards coming to the market. SAS - Serial attached SCSI Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a computer bus used to move data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives. SAS depends on a point-to-point serial protocol that replaces the parallel SCSI bus technology that first appeared in the mid 1980s in data centers and workstations, and it uses the standard SCSI command set. SAS offers backwards-compatibility with second-generation SATA drives. SATA 3 Gbit/s drives may be connected to SAS backplanes, but SAS drives may not be connected to SATA backplanes. Cables and Connectors for SATA Devices Connectors and Cables are the same for either generation. They are used on 3.5-in SATA hard disks for desktop and server computers and 2.5-in disks for laptop or small computers. SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) Actually a variety of interfaces ranging from Narrow SCSI at 40Mb/s to Ultra-640 SCSI at 5120Mb/s may be substantially more expensive than other connections, but it offers a wider range of connection and device possibilities. Frequently SCSI connections may be found in higher-speed disks, up to 15000 RPM.", "parent_text": "Computer Hardware", "keyword_density": {"hard": "1.3", "drives": "1.0", "hard drives": "0.6"}, "department_id": 1},

When a camera records just one frame per second (fps), the video appears very choppy. You will see very little correspondence between the person's mouth and the words he or she is speaking. A webcam with a frame rate of 30 fps, on the other hand, will produce video almost as fluid as a television broadcast. Another important measurement is effective pixels. The more effective pixels your web cam has, the clearer the image will be. The most basic webcams produce good images, but viewers may not be able to discern certain details.

Some devices have been built for more specific functions, allowing consumers to buy a tablet that suits their individual needs. For artists and graphic designers, a drawing tablet might be the best option. These devices are basically digital sketchbooks. Instead of drawing a design or an image and then recreating it on a laptop, a graphics tablet comes equipped with software so users can create their artwork, save it and share the file with other devices via an internet or wired connection. There are pen tablets available for designers who aren't quite ready to make the leap to touchscreen technology. Most of these devices' screens are sensitive enough that they'll respond to the pen in natural way to create different shades, styles and lines. If you aren't comfortable with the pen that a tablet came packaged with, there are other peripherals available. You can shop around until you find the pen that feels most comfortable in your hand. There are replacement parts available for some pens, which could be useful if you're worried that you'll quickly wear out your drawing tool. Consumers who don't want to untangle wires every time they need to share a new file with another device should consider buying a wireless connection kit. A USB wireless connector enables sharing with any PC, even if the design tablet was not built with wireless sharing. Don't forget to buy a carrying case, so your device is well-protected during transport. Screens are very sensitive and will be susceptible to scratches and scuff marks if left exposed to the elements. A graphics tablet could be the perfect device for any artist who wants to work digitally but feels limited by the creation tools available on a computer.", "parent_text": "Input Devices", "keyword_density": {"graphics tablet": "1.3", "tablet": "2.5"}, "department_id": 1},

Shoppers can find and choose the right Mac hard drive by thinking about storage and portability needs. To figure out what size hard drive you should buy, think about how much computing you do each day and how many files you save. If you're a heavy user, consider buying a drive with terabytes (TB) of available storage. You'll be able to save an entire system to a device with that much room, so if you need a new computer, you will be able to reinstall everything as it was previously. These units are beneficial to people who work in creative industries and have libraries that are too expansive for a single Mac external hard drive. For example, a photographer who has hundreds of thousands of pictures saved on his or her desktop won't be able to back everything up with a smaller unit. Casual consumers should consider drives with a few hundred gigabytes (GB) of space. Buying a device with TBs of data storage would result in a great deal of wasted space for users who only have a couple thousand files that need to be saved. If you plan on bringing your external Mac hard drive everywhere you go, you'll want to purchase a unit that is light and damage-resistant. Some drives are smaller than most tablets, while other devices are large enough to be confused with video game consoles. If you're prone to damaging your gadgets, consider a drive with pads and shock protectors to defend against significant bumps and bruises. Time Machine is a convenient program to help ensure that every file is saved, and buying the right Mac hard drive can help Mac users make the most of the program.", "parent_text": "Hard Drives", "keyword_density": {"external hard": "1.3", "hard": "1.9", "drives": "0.6", "external": "1.0"}, "department_id": 1},

Understanding Internal Hard Drive Specifications When selecting a hard drive, there are two main things to consider: speed and capacity. Budget permitting, always go for the fastest drive you can. Speed is measured using the RPM figure a faster rotational speed means greater performance, especially in games, but may cause greater heat and noise. The capacity, measured in GB (gigabytes), should depend on your own storage requirements. A higher capacity drive will invariably cost more than a lower capacity drive, so a balance must usually be struck between capacity and cost.

While tablets may be lighter, depending on the specific make and model, almost no device can match the functionality and convenience of a portable computer. Buying the right laptop accessories could create an even better user experience by making devices safer and supplementing the hardware. One of a laptop's biggest conveniences is its portability, but it can be awkward to carry in hand and doing so increases the odds of an accident - like being dropped on the sidewalk. A padded backpack can carry a laptop of any size while protecting the device from the elements. Laptop bags and cases are designed to absorb most bumps and bruises, so any valuables stored inside are less likely to be damaged during transit. You might also want to protect your laptop from potential thieves. Putting a lock on a computer would make it difficult for anyone to just walk away with it. Many laptops come with a security slot, so you might want to take advantage of it for additional security measures. Heavier users may find it difficult to find a device that can meet all their demands. A laptop battery can lose power quickly when the machine is asked to handle too many tasks at once. Sometimes there might not be an available outlet, so a power adapter is necessary to provide the extra juice needed to finish an important project before the charge dies. Additionally, most batteries last longer if a laptop does not overheat. Unfortunately, it's easy for a system's internal fan to be obstructed because they are mostly located on the bottom. A cooling pad could supplement a laptop's fans and prevent damage caused by excessive heat. Most of these devices connect via a USB port but have additional outlets so users can still connect flash drives with their computer while the cooling pad is working. Newegg is proud to offer a variety of laptop accessories, including laptop batteries, AC adapters, extended warranties, add-on cards, laptop bags and cases, hard drives, memory, networking devices, luggage & bags, replicators, docking stations and solid state disks.

These slim pieces of machinery also come packed with high-powered features, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice performance for portability and style. Next-generation ultrabooks To actually qualify as an Ultrabook, a PC must meet certain Intel quality standards for speed and processing power. In addition to being lightweight like its netbook predecessor, an Ultrabook must be thin. Most weigh less than three pounds and are under an inch thick when closed. Also, the high-definition resolution of an Ultrabook is superior to most monitors available today. The everlasting battery A short charge is the bane of every laptop user's existence. To combat poor performance and running time, Intel requires ultrabooks to feature at least five hours of battery life. An all-day battery would be a dream come true for most consumers. Currently, the best ultrabooks offer about eight hours of battery life, which would be particularly convenient for users who can't constantly recharge their devices. For instance, college students and traveling businesspeople won't have to worry about their laptops if Intel keeps its promise. Touchscreen may be the future Ultrabooks and tablets are strong competitors among the tech industry mainly because the devices share a great deal of similarities. Both machines are convenient for mobile use and allow users to complete basic tasks. The biggest difference between tablets and ultrabooks is their software. Tablets run on mobile operating systems like Android and iOS, while ultrabooks feature Windows 7. With Windows 8 , however, the gap between the gadgets might close completely. The next-generation of ultrabooks will look completely different from today's computers. Technological innovations and increased performance standards will force manufacturers to build high-quality laptops. If computers with all-day battery life, touchscreen capabilities and 1080p resolution become the standard, then it's difficult to imagine that there are further improvements that manufacturers could make.", "parent_text": "PCs & Laptops", "keyword_density": {"ultrabook": "3.3"}, "department_id": 3},

Traditional notebooks , on the other hand, are more unique than their slim counterparts because companies don't have to adhere to the universal code.

You can take notebooks anywhere as long as the battery is fully charged or there's an electrical outlet available to serve as a power source. Unfortunately, laptop batteries degrade over time - they store less electricity and die faster as they age. Even the best power supplies start to wear down after months of consistent use. For laptops that have a removable battery, it's easy find a replacement unit. If you know the make and model of your laptop, you can find the right battery easily. Because computers have different connection ports, it's important to find the power supply built specifically for your line of laptop. Some manufacturers offer universal batteries for notebooks that they no longer produce or support. A functioning AC adapter is another necessity for every computer, as no battery can last more than a few hours on a single charge. Like the batteries, it's important to find a compatible laptop charger for a notebook's electrical jack. Some users bring their laptops everywhere - from home to work or school and everywhere in between. Chargers can wear out from being repeatedly unplugged, and if they break there's no way to keep the notebooks they are connected to from losing power. Having a backup on hand in case of emergencies eliminates any unnecessary stress caused by waiting for a replacement. For added convenience, use one as a travel charger and leave the other at home, so you don't have to constantly unplug an adapter every time you go out.

You can still purchase them and install them on your existing computer. Even manufacturers like Dell, that have stopped making them standard on new computers, still offer them as an option. Another reason floppy drives have hung on for so long is because older operating systems support them. For older systems, there is no option to use newer media like CD, DVD, or flash drives. For people with older systems or with much of their data stored on disks, there is still a need for floppy drives. Floppy Drives Are Still an Option CD-ROMs were the first technology to begin to replace floppy drives. They hold nearly 650 times as much as a single floppy diskette, and are as portable and inexpensive as floppy disks. The zip drive, only made by Iomega, did not catch on as widely as CD-ROMs did. Today most software comes on CD or is downloadable. There is little need for people to use floppy drives. For the transportation factor, writeable CDs are just as mobile as floppies and store much more data. USB \"thumb\" drives that use flash memory are also quite portable and even more durable than CDs, which are prone to scratching. They cost very little and hold much more than floppies.

Wireless network routers will allow you to connect computers, notebook computers, PDAs and printers without wires. They are also useful for connecting laptops to the Internet and other networks, such as at work or at home.

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal. The DVI connector is mainstream equipment on newer video cards and on an increasing number of new LCD monitors. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors are necessary for displays with HD resolution approaching that of HDTV, from 720-1080 lines per frame, and they're backwards-compatible with DVI systems.

CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient. However, the prices of external hard drives have come down so much that they are perfect for backing up your important data. The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it. Considerations for External Hard Drives One drawback to using external hard drives for backups is that they are still relatively new for home computer use. They come with Windows drivers; should Windows fail, you will not be able to access your external drive through DOS.

Users need the access port to watch DVDs, burn discs, copy music files and install software. As with most technology, the devices are sensitive and can malfunction, leading to the need for repair or replacement. For consumers that have experienced electrical failure with their CD/DVD drive, there are replacement drives available that can be easily installed into the old device's slot. This is a cost-effective alternative to hiring a technician or sending a computer to a retailer or manufacturer for repairs. The most important part of buying a new CD Rom drive is finding out if it is compatible with your system. You can check by reading your computer's hardware specifications and matching them against what a new drive requires. Ultra-slim notebooks and netbooks do not come with an internal DVD Rom drive, so users have no access to disc-based content. There are external drives available so consumers can watch DVDs or use a CD for storage. Most of these devices connect to a device via a USB cord. Some require two USB ports, so it's important for shoppers to buy one that matches the port availability of their computers. Being able to access content from CDs and DVDs is a necessity for most users. There is no need to buy a whole new system if a drive burns out, because they are detachable from a computer in most cases. Shoppers should research every piece of hardware before purchasing to avoid wasteful spending and the hassle of exchanging one piece of equipment for another. The first CD drive a consumer buys can be the last, by making sure it is compatible with their computer ahead of time.", "parent_text": "CD / DVD / Blu Ray Burners & Media", "keyword_density": {"dvd": "1.7", "drives": "0.7", "cd": "2.0"}, "department_id": 1},

Unfortunately for users, most PC's do not have a Blu-ray burner as standard equipment, so consumers cannot copy their image and video files onto the discs. The good news is that shoppers can find an external Blu-ray burner so all their content can be stored on Blu-ray discs and be displayed in the highest definition possible. Instead of being limited to burning DVDs, you can share your home movies and photography with friends and family in a format featuring unmatched picture quality. Blu-ray discs have greater storage capacity than other file back-up methods, like DVDs and some flash drives. It is also easier to share content through a disc than giving a close friend your camera to cycle through vacation pictures or sending videos in a multimedia message from your smartphone. Blu-ray discs provide flexibility regarding which formats it can save, so users can back-up all their content regardless of how the file was saved or which program was used to create it. Unlike an external hard drive, there is no chance for a disc to malfunction electronically unless it is scratched, and the only way to lose any data is to misplace the disc. Finding the best Blu-ray burner for you means considering your needs and what would be compatible with your PC. Not every external disc writer is supported by a computer's hardware, so it's important to figure out what your equipment can work with and what would be a wasteful purchase. Buying a burner from the same manufacturer as your computer could help avoid incompatibility issues. Some Blu-ray writers have a limited warranty, so if you're concerned about the longevity of the device or potential system incompatibility, these may be the best available options.
