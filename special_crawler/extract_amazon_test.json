      "long_description": "The Inspiron 15 is the most economical member of the family, offering a great combination of portability and plenty of screen real estate along with a 10-key numeric keypad next to the keyboard.\n      \n         \n       \n        Features Designed for easy travel The Inspiron 15 starts at about 1\" thin, so it slips easily into a travel bag for when you\u2019re\u00a0on the move. Its textured lid and palm rest help you get a grip on things. Affordable performance Multitask on a budget With quick, efficient Intel Celeron processors and Windows 8.1 apps, Bing Smart\u00a0Search and more, you can turn around tasks easily, whether you\u2019re online or offline. Charge ahead Stay powered up long enough to skip the in-flight movie, polish your presentation or drift\u00a0off to your favorite music with up to 6.25 hours of battery life. Add it up A 10-key numeric keypad makes managing spreadsheets and balancing budgets a breeze. Enhanced viewing Beautiful display: Get lost in this stunning 15.6\" HD WLED screen with 1366x768 resolution and the high-contrast provided by Truelife technology. Huge hard drive: Pack hours of TV shows, music and movies on the available 500GB hard drive. Reader at the ready: Can\u2019t find your camera cables? Just upload media files right from your camera\u2019s card with a built-in 4-in-1 media card reader. Practical ports: Connect to an HDTV or HD monitor with an HDMI 1.4 port for an even bigger home theater experience. Or join MP3 players, cameras, external drives and\u00a0more with its two available USB 2.0 ports. Please note, the Inspiron 15 has no optical drive, Ethernet port or Bluetooth connectivity. Designed for the real world \u2014 because that's where life happens. We want you to love your new PC for years to come. That's why we test Inspiron laptops for reliability not just\u00a0in the places where you expect it, but for the open road ahead. Turn up the heat: From locker rooms to locked cars, we test Inspiron laptops for survival in harsh short-term\u00a0heat conditions of up to 65\u00b0C/149\u00b0F. Everything hinges on it: We test Inspiron laptop hinges to ensure they still feel tight, even after opening and\u00a0closing the lid 20,000 times. Keys to success: We test commonly used keys for 10 million keystrokes and touch pad buttons 1 million times\u00a0with no failure. So go ahead, finish your novel. Buttoned up: No matter what you set your power and multimedia buttons to do, we've tested them all to\u00a0survive up to 40,000 pushes. Twist and turn: Call us excessive, but after twisting an Inspiron laptop's base and lid more than 25,000 times,\u00a0we can assure you the parts inside are well protected. Always a good fit: You'll probably never need to remove and reinstall your Inspiron's battery 750 times, but you\u00a0can rest easy knowing that we've tested even that.
