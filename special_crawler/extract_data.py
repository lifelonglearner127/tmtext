class Scraper():

    """Base class for scrapers
    Handles incoming requests and calls specific methods from subclasses
    for each requested type of data,
    making sure to minimize number of requests to the site being scraped

    Each subclass must implement:
    - define DATA_TYPES and DATA_TYPES_SPECIAL structures (see subclass docs)
    - implement each method found in the values of the structures above
    - implement checktree_html_format()

    Attributes:
        product_page_url (string): URL of the page of the product being scraped
        tree_html (lxml tree object): html tree of page source. This variable is initialized
        whenever a request is made for a piece of data in DATA_TYPES. So it can be used for methods
        extracting these types of data.
        MAX_RETRIES (int): number of retries before giving up fetching product page soruce (if errors encountered
            - usually IncompleteRead exceptions)
