This is a simple service that provides a queue of URLs and allows to store the results of processing those URLs.


To try it I recommend:
# cd url_service
# virtualenv --clear .
# source bin/activate
# pip install pyramid
# pip install requests
# python url_service.py

In another terminal:
# cd url_service
# source bin/activate
# python -m unittest tests_url_service.py

If that works, the environment is OK and the service is working properly.

The drawbacks of the code are:
- Uses SQLite directly (no abstraction layer like SqlAlchemy).
- Writes to the location of url_service.py.
