Spiders for each sitemap from list sitemaps_list.txt

Each spider can be run from its own folder, with *scrapy crawl <spider_name>*.

This will result in output files with the crawling results, in *<spider_name>_categories.jl* files.

The main code for each spider is found in each spider's subdirectory called *spiders*, in the *<spider_name>_spider.py* file.
