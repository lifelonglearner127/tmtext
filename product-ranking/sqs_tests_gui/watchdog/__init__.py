# This package helps to find bugs in spiders.
# You specify some values that must exist in spider responses.
# Then the spider runs periodically for some urls. Also, url2screenshot runs for the same urls.
# If these values not present or invalid in the just-arrived response,
# the url2screenshot spider's screenshot is saved (as a bug-report).
